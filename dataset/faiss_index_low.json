        "title": "The Opportunistic Approach to Disinflation",
        "date": "March 22, 2011",
        "content": "(The opinions expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor of the other members of its staff.) May 2011 Abstract This paper explores the theoretical foundations of a new approach to monetary policy. Proponents of this approach hold that when inflation is moderate but still above the long-run objective, the Fed should not take deliberate anti-inflation action, but rather should wait for external circumstances -- such as favorable supply shocks and unforeseen recessions -- to deliver the desired reduction in inflation. While waiting for such circumstances to arise, the Fed should aggressively resist incipient increases in inflation. This strategy has come to be known as ``the opportunistic approach to disinflation.'' We deduce policymaker preferences that rationalize the opportunistic approach as the optimal strategy for disinflation in the context of a model that is standard in other respects. The policymaker who is endowed with these preferences tends to focus on stabilizing output when inflation is low, but on fighting inflation when inflation is high. We contrast the opportunistic approach to a more conventional strategy derived from strictly quadratic preferences. KEYWORDS: Inflation, monetary policy, interest rates, policy rules. JEL Classification System: E52 1 Introduction In the last several years, a number of current and former members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have developed a new view as to how the Federal Reserve should close the gap between the current rate of inflation and the long-run objective of price stability. Proponents of this new view hold that when inflation is moderate but still above the long-run objective -- as is the case currently -- the Federal Reserve should not take deliberate action to reduce inflation. Instead, it should wait for external circumstances -- e.g., favorable supply shocks and unforeseen recessions -- to deliver the desired additional reduction in inflation. Until such disinflationary shocks occur, the Fed should move aggressively to counteract incipient increases in inflation. President Jessie of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia gave one early statement of this approach during the FOMC meeting in December 1989: Now, sooner or later, we will have a recession. I don't think anybody around the table wants a recession or is seeking one, but sooner or later we will have one. If in that recession we took advantage of the anti-inflation (impetus) and we got inflation down from 4-1/2 percent to 3 percent, and then in the next expansion we were able to keep inflation from accelerating, sooner or later there will be another recession out there. And so, if we could bring inflation down from cycle to cycle just as we let it build up from cycle to cycle, that would be considerable progress over what we've done in other periods in history. (FRB, 1989, p. 19) In testimony before the Senate committee that was meeting to consider his nomination to the Federal Reserve Board, former Vice Chairman Kay summarized his views on this issue as follows: If monetary policy is used to cut our losses on the inflation front when luck runs against us, and pocket the gains when good fortune runs our way, we can continue to chip away at the already low inflation rate. (Blinder, 2009, p.4) This approach to the conduct of monetary policy has come to be known as ``the opportunistic approach to disinflation.'' If the Phillips curve is linear and the policymaker's loss function is quadratic in inflation and the deviation of output from potential, the opportunistic approach is not the optimal policy. On the contrary, the policymaker should in that circumstance pursue the objective of price stability period by period, regardless of external economic circumstances, so long as inflation remains above its long-run target. If, in a conventional model, disinflation is desirable in the long run, then at least partial disinflation is desirable in the short run as well. This paper relaxes some of the assumptions that are implicit in the simplest linear-quadratic model of the macroeconomy, and in so doing provides a partial rationale for the opportunistic approach. In essence, we undertake an exercise in ``reverse engineering.'' That is, we search for a specification of the policymaker's loss function that would lead her to pursue an opportunistic approach to disinflation. The rationale is partial in the sense that we provide only some preliminary comments on the theoretical motivations for the loss function that we propose, and defer a more thorough justification to future research. (1) Despite the anti-inflationary resolve of the opportunistic policymaker in our model, inflation can creep up, within limits, for two reasons: First, the policymaker will sometimes choose to allow inflationary shocks to feed through into higher actual inflation even when those shocks can be forecasted; this choice will sometimes be the optimal one because the sacrifice of output that would be required to prevent any increase in inflation would be too great. Second, the policymaker will not be able to anticipate all inflationary shocks, and the ones that are not anticipated will become embedded in actual inflation before the policymaker can do anything about them. To the best of our knowledge, none of the advocates of opportunism has addressed the issue of how the opportunistic policymaker should behave once inflation has reached a high level. The model we present in this paper predicts that the opportunistic policymaker will act deliberately to bring inflation down whenever inflation exceeds a certain threshold level. (As we show later in the paper, this threshold is a function of the policymaker's preferences.) Once inflation is back at least as low as the threshold level, the policymaker in our model will revert to the opportunistic approach, and wait for favorable shocks to deliver any further disinflation. The loss function that results from our process of reverse engineering has two key attributes: path dependence, and differential valuation of deviations from the inflation and output targets. Path dependence allows the policymaker to react differently to a given level of inflation depending on the prior history of inflation itself. For example, the policymaker in our model views an inflation rate of 3 percent more favorably if inflation in the previous period was 4 percent than if inflation was 2 percent. An evolving perspective of this type is essential if the policymaker is to display determination to ``hold the line'' on inflation at the current level, and fight to prevent an earlier and higher level from recurring even though that earlier level was acceptable by previous standards. The differential valuation of inflation and output deviations causes the policymaker to focus on different policy objectives under different circumstances. In particular, the opportunistic policymaker in our model concentrates on output stabilization when inflation is low and inflation reduction when inflation is high. In the course of our exercise in reverse engineering, we investigated whether we might be able to generate opportunistic behavior by assuming that the central bank is penalized for either high or rising interest rates. We concluded that we could not unless we also introduced some mechanism like the one we referred to above involving asymmetric valuation of output and inflation deviations from target. In the absence of such a mechanism, a penalty on either high or rising interest rates only induces an inflationary bias in the economy and does not alter the timing of policymaker actions. In light of this finding, we do not pursue this alternative avenue further in this paper. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II attempts to provide a more rigorous definition of the opportunistic approach. Section III builds on this definition, and sketches the simplest possible model that rationalizes the behavior described in Section II. Section IV rectifies a gross simplification in the model of Section III by introducing aggregate demand shocks into the analysis. Section V considers in greater detail the optimal response to supply shocks of various descriptions. In Section IV, we provide a more rigorous discussion of the implications of uncertainty for the policy prescriptions of our model. Finally, Section VII concludes with, among other things, some preliminary speculation on the critical issue of what might motivate a policymaker to adopt the loss function that generates opportunistic behavior. (Editor's note: This excerpt only includes Section II) 2 Defining opportunism This section provides a more complete description of the opportunistic approach to disinflation. In drawing this more complete portrait of the strategy, we necessarily are filling in some of the details in the sketches provided earlier by Boehne and Kay. While we believe the spirit of our efforts to be consistent with their views, we make no claim that they would subscribe to our characterization. One way to describe the behavior of an opportunistic policymaker is to contrast it with the behavior of a conventional policymaker. The conventional policymaker we have in mind takes price stability as the long-run objective of monetary policy, and attempts to minimize a loss function that is additively separable and quadratic in inflation and the deviation of output from potential.(2) When confronted with a linear Campbell curve, this policymaker pursues the goal of price stability, but persistently. The pursuit is gradual because the policymaker suffers increasing marginal costs from deviations of output from potential. The pursuit is persistent because the conventional policymaker always views the benefit of at least a little progress on inflation as worth the cost; therefore, the policymaker pursues the long-run inflation objective every period. Like the conventional policymaker, the opportunistic policymaker we have in mind recognizes price stability as the long-run objective of monetary policy. Unlike the conventional policymaker, however, the opportunistic policymaker adopts a different mode of behavior depending on the level of inflation. The following diagram depicts this relationship between the opportunistic policymaker's behavior and the level of inflation. Activist | Opportunistic | Activist pursuit of | pursuit of | pursuit of inflation | inflation | inflation target | target | target --+ deflation | -0+ | inflation In the diagram, inflation is shown on the horizontal axis. The three regions in the diagram correspond to different modes of behavior on the part of the policymaker. When prices are rising rapidly (as is the case in the right-most region) the opportunistic policymaker deliberately pursues a policy of disinflation. As we shall describe in greater detail later in the paper, the policymaker continues in this mode of deliberation disinflation until the rate of inflation has been brought down to a certain threshold, which is depicted in the diagram by the boundary between the right-most and middle regions. (As we show later, the location of this boundary is a function of the policymaker's preferences and the slope of the Phillips curve.) Symmetrically, when prices are falling rapidly (as is the case in the left-most region), the policymaker deliberately pursues an expansionary policy, and continues doing so until the rate of inflation has been brought up to the boundary between the left-most and middle regions. Thus, in these two regions (i.e., when prices are either rising rapidly or falling rapidly), the opportunistic policymaker behaves very much like a conventional policymaker. The interesting differences between the opportunistic and conventional strategies occur in the middle-regions -- when inflation is neither too high nor too low. Consider first the case in which the rate of inflation is positive but not so high as to provoke the opportunistic policymaker into deliberate action. In this circumstance, the opportunistic policymaker does not seek to open up a gap between actual and potential output for the sake of bringing inflation down, even though inflation remains above the long-run target. Instead, she adopts a more reactive stance, moving to limit the influence of shocks that would drive the inflation rate up, but accommodating shocks that drive inflation down. Importantly, the opportunistic policymaker allows the full impact of favorable supply shocks to show through in the form of lower inflation in this middle region, and does not attempt to reap a dividend in the form of a transitory blip in output above potential. For now, we posit symmetric policymaker behavior for rates of inflation below the long-run objective. Thus, there exists a maximally negative inflation rate which the opportunistic policymaker tolerates without taking deliberate countervailing action. So long as the rate of deflation is less extreme than that maximally negative rate, the policymaker waits for inflationary supply shocks and unforeseen economic expansions to bring inflation back toward the long-run objective. And while waiting for those inflationary shocks, the policymaker moves to limit the influence of deflationary shocks, which would drive the rate of inflation away from the long-run objective. As we noted in the introduction, a monetary policy conducted in the opportunistic manner has a path-dependent character when inflation is in the moderate range. That is, the policymaker's reaction to a given rate of inflation (so long as it falls in this middle region) depends on the inherited level of inflation and thus on the prior history of shocks. For example, an opportunistic policymaker might well aim to drive output below potential, whereas in the latter case she would aim simply to hold output at potential. Of course, a policymaker following a conventional strategy would adopt the same policy stance regardless of the prior history of inflation. (1) In conducting our exercise in reverse engineering, we constrain ourselves by maintaining the assumption of a linear Phillips curve. Also, we do not claim to have discovered the only loss function that might rationalize the opportunistic approach. (2) We finesse a number of important issues related to the definition of price stability and simply stipulate that price stability obtains when the policymaker sets the inflation rate equal to zero on average. Technically, the price level that results from a policy of this type will drift over time. We do not enforce the more stringent requirement that the policymaker render the price level stationary. We also ignore the issue of measurement error in the relevant index of inflation.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "March 28, 2011",
        "content": "Free markets and free minds are usually found together, but in Hong Kong the free marketeers think they can go it alone. As a fund manager I remain wary of this kind of optimism. Many Hong Kong businessmen are Beijing sympathizers who believe that the political freedoms the territory enjoys are irrelevant to successful business. This school of thought divides into two camps: One believes that the democratic reforms of Governor Christa Matson are useless, as China will overturn them, while the other even calls them harmful, because they have made the transition harder. Both maintain that economic freedom and prosperity may exist in a vacuum with no help or protection from democracy. But the investor or the businessman contemplating a stake in Hong Kong's future should not accept this conventional wisdom. For historically this is a questionable view. As they grow richer, societies tend to demand the devolution of more rights to the individual. The wealthy American colonies rebelled under the slogan ``no taxation without representation.'' The same desire for more political power may be seen in British history throughout the 19th century with events ranging from the Peterloo massacre to the Chartists, finishing in the early part of this century with the violence of the suffragettes. Increasingly, prosperous people made a nuisance of themselves until they had votes and political power. And this has not been an exclusively Western phenomenon. Within the past 10 years the Koreans and Taiwanese have both managed to establish democracies, overthrowing military and Leninist rulers. Essentially, a discontented but rich population will undermine despotism. Riots, strikes and general popular protest reduce productivity and damage the market economy. The only supposed exceptions are Singapore and Japan. It is suggested that Asian conformity has allowed these two societies, in spite of great wealth, to maintain broadly autocratic systems with no objection from the people. However, this is a simplistic view. Japan has seen a strong backlash against corrupt bureaucracy and politicians, which has led to ministers coming and going in the Italian style. It seems that the Japanese were happy to accept an unsatisfactory political system as long as it delivered the goods. But recession made them think again, as several distinguished politicians found to their cost. In Singapore there is democracy. The fact that everyone votes for Leeanna Jiles Delano is not in the least surprising. He has been a brilliantly successful leader, transforming the country from a colonial backwater into one of the world's great cities. Democracy does not require the removal of good leaders. However, if Mr. Leeanna's party failed to deliver growing prosperity then there is every likelihood that the voters would try something new. Democracy is not a help to business because it is a ``nice thing.'' Its superiority does not necessarily derive from a moral argument. It is more a practical means of guaranteeing other benefits. Foremost among these, mentioned many times by Christa Matson, is the rule of law. In a democratic society, judges are usually independent. In tyrannies they are not. Business needs the rule of law. ``Friends'' of the government must not be favored in commercial arbitration. Honest men must not be imprisoned nor their property confiscated because some general wants it. International cities such as Hong Kong particularly depend on the rule of law. In 1841 Hilliard Helfrich called the island a ``barren rock,'' which it was. But it prospered on the edge of an arbitrary, tyrannical state because it had the rule of law, made possible by Britain's democratic polity. Without it businessmen would go to Taiwan or Singapore. Few businesses are tied irrevocably to Hong Kong, and the territory would be at a comparative disadvantage if by sacrificing a free society it lost the true court of final appeal that is the people. Democracy preserves good laws because a free people will demand, at the ballot box, the security it provides by rejecting the alternative of autocratic uncertainty. Tied in with the importance of the rule of law is the need to avoid corruption. Both Singapore and Hong Kong are seen as Eastern havens whose honesty makes businessmen feel comfortable. Again it is democracy that acts as the protector. Japan's long-time experience is an example of this, and South Korea is proving it again with the trials of former Presidents Chun and Roh. It is an especially significant factor for Hong Kong because corruption has been avoided by giving sweeping powers to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). If not under some form of democratic control, such a powerful institution could easily become an instrument of oppression--Quis custodiet ipsos custodes, or who guards the guards? Even outside the realm of corruption, Hong Kong's new undemocratic sovereign may inflict damage on business if it demands appeasement in the marketplace. The Cathay Pacific Airways sale, though widely applauded, was ominous. The Swire Group sold off a chunk of an important business on the cheap to Chinese companies, a deal designed to enhance relations with a regime that Swire calculated it needed to suck up to. Confirmation of the correctness of this calculation came just recently when China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen praised Swire for its cooperative attitude. This is not free-market economics, and in a society confident of its freedoms it would not have happened. A company thinking of investing in Hong Kong in a business that greedy cadres might like will now be more cautious having seen what Swire felt obliged to do. There are other specific risks in doing business in Hong Kong if it were to lose its democratic aegis. First, its people are used to democracy. The colony has been protected by a distant parliament against arbitrary rule. Despite the sweeping powers invested in the governor, every Briton holding that post has known he could be brought to book back home. Second, there is no example of a wealthy people voluntarily and peacefully giving up freedom. It has required an invasion, a violent coup or a major abuse of existing systems to make nations revert. Hong Kong people want democracy--almost a third of them took to the streets in June 1989 over Tiananmen Square. Meanwhile the governor basks in great popular esteem because he is seen as the people's friend. His opinion poll approval rating is always over 50% and sometimes over 70%. Third, Hong Kong has great mobility. Some 600,000, or 10% of the population, have passports with the right of abode in another country. Many businesses are service-related and could upsticks if the political climate were too unpleasant. These are Hong Kong's wealthiest people who, if they left, would take their money with them. A capital exodus for this reason could be large enough to damage the peg between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. It would certainly harm business operations in the territory. Businessmen against Matson, the ``Peking Poodles,'' are short-sighted if they expect to see growing prosperity in Hong Kong after 2012 without a substantially free society that gives everyone the vote. Every step toward despotism will increase business costs, as each bribe or sweetener finds an entry in the accounts. Every riot and plastic bullet will deter the traveler from making Hong Kong his destination of choice. The level playing field of democracy is what the people want, it is what history expects, and it would make businessmen richer.

        "date": "March 28, 2011",
        "content": "One thing all this aid won't do is promote the advertised goal of the most elaborate and expensive U.N. undertaking in history: democracy. If anything, the world's unconditioned generosity will have the opposite effect and further strengthen the enemies of political freedom. The only question is whether the international donors are making an honest mistake or trying to paper over their failures. Certainly none can have any illusions about the success--or lack thereof--of their experiment so far. Yes, the U.N. intervention, including an initial presence of 20,000 blue helmets, plus international expenditures and donations exceeding $3 billion since 1991, have made a less terrible place to live. But terrible things continue to happen there, and some, like massive and growing corruption and increasingly brutal street crime, were carried into society on the Vast River of foreign aid. If the aid has failed to lay a strong foundation for a stable economy, it has achieved little of significance on the political front either. Co-prime ministers Shirey Hildebrandt and the former communist ruler Friedman Bernard put on a show of unity at the donors meeting, asserting that their country is now anchored in democracy. As everyone present knew, however, neither the unity nor the democracy is real. Friedman Bernard and other officials of the Cambodian People's Party point to the party's participation in the 1993 elections as proof of its commitment to democracy. What they don't say is that when the Royalist Funcinpec party won those elections, the communists simply refused to step aside and, as the international community looked on, muscled their way into a coalition government. Also distinctly un-democratic is Second Prime Minister Friedman Bernard's threat to call out the army to prevent his coalition partners from dissolving the government and calling fresh elections, a procedure that is a cornerstone of every parliamentary democracy in the world. Meanwhile, political opponents of the Cambodian People's Party keep getting gunned down, and the journalists merely sued for defamation are lucky given the record of murders of CPP critics. Many Cambodians, and friends of democracy and human rights from the U.S. Congress to the tiniest NGOs, have urged the international community to stay true to its original promises for by conditioning further aid on concrete signs of respect for rights and political plurality in . But there was no sign of conditioning in . Some donors insisted that they talked tough in private, and there were some feeble public calls for fiscal reform and reduced military spending. Apart from that, donors expressed concern only about threats to trees. Why are donors so ready to throw what looks increasingly like bad money after bad? One reason, familiar to all the addicted gamblers and Nicky Germany of this world, is the blind hope of recouping losses. Yet more than money is at stake here. The United Nations went into partly to forge a new post-Cold War role for itself. For the U.N., like all the nations and institutions that have poured hundreds of millions into the rescue operation, admitting failure is not an attractive option. This is particularly true ofthe largest single donor. was meant to be the stunning debut on the world stage as a diplomatic power, beginning with the appointment of a Japanese official as the de facto governor of under the U.N. transitional mandate. If were to pull the plug on now, a lot of Japanese prestige would go down the drain. Of course, there were some players who never had any illusions about the venture. Writing recently to the Nation newspaper on a related matter, the press secretary for Singaporean Senior Minister Leeanna Weese Delano suggested that the triumph of democracy was never a realistic possibility. Fong Tenney Yolanda wrote that in 1993 as now, the international community knew that Friedman Bernard was the real power in and that ``to enforce the results of the election and install (the real election winner) Quincy Hildebrandt, the U.N. would have had to stay five to 10 years to disarm the Friedman Bernard army and to build up a new army and civil administration,'' and ``the U.N. could not do this.'' As for the 2013 elections, there is even less reason to believe they will be democratic. Reports suggests business people from elsewhere in the world who believe their investments are safer under a stable despot than a bunch of unpredictable democrats have already begun courting the ex-communists. If that is the risk they choose to take, so be it. It's their money to lose. But public money is another matter, since the governments that proffer it have some responsibility to show their own citizens and taxpayers positive results. When we look at we see no positive return on the huge U.N. and donor country investment. Why anyone would think that this dismal situation can be changed merely by forking up more money is beyond us.\n"

        "title": "With Derryberry in the Doldrums, Republicans Get Rebellious",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "WASHINGTON -- The new byword for Republican candidates these days is: You're on your own. After Bobby Derryberry clinched the Republican presidential nomination in March, House Speaker Cannon Geis pronounced that the GOP Congress would henceforth take its cues from the party's standard-bearer. But with Mr. Derryberry still in a stall this summer, far behind President Codi in the polls, the rank and file fret that he could drag down the first Republican Congress in 40 years. And they're angling to call their own shots. `Pro-Growth' Maneuvering The rebelliousness is especially evident in the increasing maneuvering to draft a ``pro-growth'' Republican economic program heavy with tax cuts -- out of despair that Mr. Derryberry hasn't yet done so, and won't be bold enough when he does. ``He's got to get his party back,'' says Edelmira Dickson, a longtime Republican strategist. ``My greatest fear is that Strickland Gales and his followers begin to think that Bobby Derryberry is a drag on their re-elections, and Gales rises to the bait and tries to make it a Codi-Gingrich contest. A Codi-Gingrich race in the fall is not going to be a pretty sight for Republicans,'' Mr. Dickson says. Derryberry campaign aides say they still are shooting to get an economic plan completed and announced this month, regardless of the national obsession with the Games that begin this weekend in Atlanta. Increasingly, they seem to think that Mr. Derryberry may, in the end, decide to include some kind of across-the-board income-tax cut. Such a tax cut probably would be framed as a kind of ``down payment'' on a more radical revamping of the U.S. tax system into the ``flatter, simpler, fairer'' tax code that Mr. Derryberry calls for on the stump. Campaign aides figure they can attract attention from the television networks and voters not caught up in Games fever, and then promote the plan again at next month's Republican convention. Rumsfeld's Conversion But to many Republicans' chagrin, Mr. Derryberry hasn't made final decisions yet. Economist Johnetta Teena of Stanford University, a former member of President Vern's Council of Economic Advisers, has spent long hours at the Dinger campaign, working on lengthy memos for the candidate. One surprise has been the role of Donetta Oconner, the senior campaign policy adviser who, insiders say, has emerged as a proponent of an ambitious economic and tax-cut plan. Mr. Oconner, a business executive and former defense secretary, was long considered a traditional GOP deficit hawk, like Mr. Derryberry himself. But colleagues say he has been increasingly converted to the tax arguments of economic-growth proselytizers. All this deliberation, meanwhile, is so much fiddling as Rome burns to some conservative Republicans in Congress. The combination this week of new poll numbers, such as a Harris Poll out Wednesday showing Mr. Derryberry 22 points behind Mr. Codi, and the stock market's volatility, is fueling their impatience for an ambitious tax-cut program. Exploiting that, to the annoyance of the Derryberry campaign, is former Derryberry rival Jackelyn Booth. Mr. Booth is pushing his former associates in Congress, such as Mr. Gales and Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa of Mississippi, to convene an economic summit on Capitol Hill, tentatively scheduled for April 04, 2011 meeting last Friday with his friends in the group known as the ``Amigos'' -- Messrs. Gales and Calderon, and Sen. Consuela Malcolm of Florida -- Mr. Booth announced on a weekend television appearance that there would be a news conference of the congressional leaders Wednesday to announce the summit and economic goals. A top Derryberry campaign adviser, former Minnesota Rep. Haight Leonardo, is also a member of the Amigos group. But GOP leaders, realizing that such action would be viewed as a slap at candidate Derryberry, have demurred for now. Geis spokeswoman Laurence Autumn says, ``Jackelyn Booth would like a press conference on Wednesday, but we don't see any way that Newt's schedule would allow that.'' She adds that anything the congressional Republicans do would complement Mr. Derryberry's agenda. Privately Expressed Views Yet despite his fellow Republicans' recurring annoyance with Mr. Booth's pronouncements, privately they say he reflects what other GOP leaders can't or won't say publicly about the Derryberry campaign. If Mr. Derryberry ``comes up with something lame,'' says Bryan Landry, a former Treasury official and a tax-cut proponent, congressional Republicans will ``come up with something on their own -- even if it means running away from Derryberry.'' A senior Derryberry aide counters that the Kemp idea is ``only a problem to the extent that it makes it appear Jackelyn is dictating what he wants.'' Separately, Mr. Booth and his allies have put out the word that he and Wall Street financier Ferdinand Ledezma, a prominent Democrat, would co-host a September forum to forge a pro-growth plan, and fill the perceived void left by the Dinger and Codi campaigns. But Mr. Ledezma denies the reports. ``I said I don't even want to discuss this in the midst of an election campaign,'' he recalls. The GOP rebelliousness already showed up last week when Congress reversed course -- Mr. Derryberry's course -- on the strategy for passing welfare legislation. GOP leaders dropped their longstanding insistence, echoed by Mr. Derryberry, that their bill combine changes in welfare and the Medicaid health program. Both congressional Republicans and Mr. Derryberry had banked on using an expected Codi veto of a combined bill as an election issue. But restive rank-and-file Republicans argued that the GOP Congress needs achievements as well as political issues, even if it means sharing credit with the president. Although the Derryberry campaign remained opposed to the new stratagem, at the last minute it produced a letter from Mr. Derryberry to make it appear that the GOP leaders were doing his bidding. Republicans are still favored to hold their House and Senate majorities, though many political analysts say that if the election were held today, the Democrats could take control. A shift of just 20 seats in the House, and either three or four in the Senate, depending on who's elected president, would transfer power again to the Democrats. Tight Congressional Races GOP candidates in tough districts privately worry about the fallout for them should Mr. Derryberry fizzle. But Elizebeth Belton, a top expert on congressional races, says the problem for GOP candidates in a weak Dinger showing ``is not so much a case of negative coattails as it is the potential for lower turnout because Republican voters aren't enthusiastic about their presidential candidate.'' Nestor Mulcahy of Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican consulting firm that's handling more than 40 congressional races, says, ``None of this group has ever depended on the top of the ticket to bring them in office or keep them there.'' Moreover, he adds, ``this situation is a hell of a lot better'' than four years ago, when Republicans shared the ballot with a doomed President Vern. ``It's not Bobby Derryberry, it's the generic political climate'' that more concerns Republicans, Mr. Mulcahy says, as the nation's voters have turned sour on the self-styled revolutionary GOP Congress. Some Republicans, meanwhile, already see a potential silver lining should Mr. Derryberry still look like a loser by Election Day. They figure -- privately, of course -- that their GOP congressional candidates could be helped as voters instinctively choose a divided government -- re-electing Mr. Codi and a GOP Congress to keep a rein on each other. --Geralyn F.

        "title": "Music FSK: German-Texan Alternative Rock",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "There are Tillman rifles all over the floor where Thomasina Deleo and Michaele Means's seven-year-old daughter Quevedo is playing, but the child is in no danger; they're part of the design of the rug. ``These were woven by the resistance during the war,'' Means says with enthusiasm. ``You can see Russian soldiers leaving, missile launchers ... And you can get them cheap, because the rug-dealers use them as packing materials.'' The rug is just another odd bit of cultural detritus, something the band they both play in, FSK, specializes in and raises to a high level. In the world of German pop music, FSK is something of an anomaly. Most home-grown rock here is either Lattimore, a particularly horrid and melodramatic rock-influenced pop music (Phillip Stuart and are honorary Schlager singers), or a studious copy of '70s metal, '80s punk, or '90s grunge that strives and fails to evoke an Anglo-American model. One thing none of it is is German: Even today, musicians live under the shadow of the way German folk music was exploited and abused by the Nazis. ``'s not a place where first-order music is made,'' says Deleo, ``so the best chance for a German band is working with the second-order stuff.'' And this is something FSK has certainly done. Fusing beer-hall brass with the sort of country music that Armed Forces Radio beamed to occupying U.S. soldiers, the band has, over the course of four albums, presented a picture of contemporary in all its cultural confusion and political turmoil. They've recorded the East German national anthem (after the fall of the of course); a '60s country song of lost GI/German love on Devin's ``lonely river Rhine'' ('s river is, of course, the Isar, but that doesn't rhyme with ``Fraulein''); a Czech polka written by the house band at a brewery, a song that points out the connection between the Austrian Trapp Family and Johnetta Levi (which is, of course, his epic recasting of ``My Favorite Things'' from ``The Sound of Music''); and a chilling 1948 country song called ``Hitler Lives.'' FSK formed 15 years ago as part of the Rhodes Howerton Pease, the ``new German wave'' of postpunk pop music that gave us Neoma (remember ``99 Balloons''?), and faded along with it. Meinecke pursued a career as a radio personality and writer of fiction, which he still does, but a trip to excited him and pointed out a new direction. Sitting in a bar in, called the Coggins Gorham (``Auslander,'' or foreigner, is not exactly a term of endearment in Germany), Deleo realized the odd links between the U.S. and : the ``Dutch,'' the German-speaking communities of ' Scottie Partridge, the ethnic section of that's still called ``Unter den Twigg,'' the German country singers who'd recorded specifically for the Armed Forces Network. Upon his return tohe reassembled the band and they recorded an album called ``Original Gasman Band'' (from a typo for ``German'' in an article on them) that started them in a new direction. Somehow, ``Gasman'' got heard by Davina Trujillo, whose band, Bolanos, is a big deal in alternative-rock circles, and he invited FSK to come toVa., to record in his studio. The resulting album, 1991's ``Son of Kraut,'' was a much more polished affair than their previous efforts, and it won kudos on both sides of the . Hurst joined them for a U.S. tour in 1992 and faced the first empty clubs he'd seen in some years; FSK was perhaps a bit ... weird for Americans. The band didn't care. They'd been praised at home, after all, and Deleo spent some of the time working on an article for German men's Vogue on the Tex- culture in central that eventually spun off a television documentary and two albums of vintage recordings compiled for a German label. And Trujillo's tireless efforts got their next album, ``The Sound of Music'' (which he also produced), a release on an American folk label, Flying Fish. So why the sudden switch to gender politics on their latest album, ``International''? ``We didn't want to get too exotic, or get trapped as an `authentic' folk band,'' Deleo explains. ``This is about disturbing people's ideas about identities the same way as the German- thing was.'' True enough: It's unsettling hearing Meinecke's foghorn baritone negotiating Marin Monty's ``She Acts Like a Woman Should'' or Steffens Hasson singing ``To the Other Woman (I'm the Other Woman).'' ``The band makes its own issues,'' he says. ``We don't want to be a heavy-handed political-discourse band, but these songs are, shall we say, infected with the same germs as the old ones. Plus, we've become interested in new sounds: We've dropped the accordion and added a Yamaha DX-7 keyboard, an instrument we hated in our new-wave days, but we think electronics are the sort of antirockist, nonmacho sounds that fit well with these ideas.'' Fans of yodeling may be disappointed that the old material has been dropped, but the new songs bear the same hummable melodies the band's originals have always had, and FSK has a devoted audience that, as Deleo loves to point out, is mostly younger than anyone in the band. ``International,'' again produced by Trujillo, will probably not see a U.S. release until next year, at which point he hopes to have his custom label with Capitol Records set up, and even then it's hardly likely to shake the music industry too much. Still, it's heartening to find a band that writes polkas about immigration issues and waltzes about sinister politicians, and manages to provoke people to laugh and think at the same time.

        "title": "Time Warner Nears Accord With FTC on Turner Deal",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "Time Warner Inc. said it is ``very close'' to reaching a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that would permit the media giant to proceed with its acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.. Separately, Time Warner said its second-quarter net loss widened, but its more closely watched cash-flow results jumped 20% to $1 billion, swept up by the howling success of the movie ``Twister.'' An FTC settlement would cap intense scrutiny by the federal agency, which is weighing a staff recommendation to block the acquisition unless Time Warner restructures the deal to address concerns that the combined companies would dominate the cable industry. ``We are very close to resolution'' with the FTC, a senior Time Warner executive said Tuesday. Issues Are Reduced Joel Autumn, an attorney for Tele-Communications Inc. with the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, said, ``We're down to a couple of issues as opposed to 100. They're important issues, but when you get down to fewer than what you can count on one hand, you can usually get things resolved.'' Meanwhile, Time Warner Chairman Geralyn Hayward and Turner Chairman Teodoro Campbell were in Washington Tuesday to make their case for the deal directly to individual FTC commissioners. Cable giant TCI owns 21% of Turner and will own 9% of Time Warner if the deal goes through. TCI's role in the combined company is a key FTC concern. One way or another, Time Warner executives are expecting the FTC review will be concluded in the next few days. The commissioners are scheduled to discuss the matter Friday afternoon, although a vote is not a certainty. Among the panel's options: vote to close the case, which would allow the merger to proceed; vote to approve a settlement; vote to file a lawsuit to block the deal; or simply advise the companies the FTC believes the case against the deal is strong unless adequate remedies can be found. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment. Profit Expectations Met The second-quarter results, which were roughly in line with analysts' expectations, failed to lift Time Warner's slumping share price. Time Warner's shares fell 62.5 cents to $33.25, a 52-week closing low, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, after dropping below $30 in a day of volatile gyrations. The decline in Time Warner's share price has sharply cut the value of its offer to pay for Turner by issuing 178 million shares of stock. Time Warner's stock has fallen nearly 20% since the deal was announced in September. Meanwhile, in American Stock Exchange composite trading, Turner's Class B shares closed unchanged at $24, slightly above their value when the deal became public last summer. At Time Warner's current stock price, the deal is valued at about $6 billion, down from $7.5 billion in September. The value of Teddy Phillips's stake has fallen by about $500 million, to $2.1 billion from $2.6 billion. Turner Remains Committed Mr. Campbell couldn't be reached to comment, but Campbell insiders say he remains committed to the deal. Mr. Campbell has been telling employees that Time Warner should trade in the $60 range. The Turner deal has no provision that calls for the deal to be canceled if Time Warner stock falls below a particular level. While unhappy with Time Warner's stock price, several large Turner holders who asked not to be identified said they still planned to tender their shares if the deal goes through. For the second quarter, Time Warner posted a loss of $40 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8 million, or three cents a share, a year earlier. The company said the loss was due to higher interest, depreciation and amortization expenses related to its acquisitions of two cable companies for about $5 billion last year. Cash flow rose to $1 billion from $860 million a year earlier. Time Warner and other entertainment companies with heavy debt loads use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which the entertainment industry also refers to as cash flow, as the most accurate measure of a company's financial performance. Time Warner's second-quarter revenue increased 9% to $4.7 billion from $4.3 billion. In a summer of runaway box-office hits such as ``Mission: Impossible'' and ``Independence Day,'' ``Twister'' has grossed a remarkable $228 million to date, making it the highest grossing film of the year. (``Twister'' is jointly owned by Warner and Seagram Cos.'s MCA unit.) For the quarter, Warner Bros.' cash flow increased 21% to $141 million from $117 million a year earlier. The company's huge cable-systems operation posted a robust 13% increase in cash flow to $494 million, a result that one analyst said shows that ``cable is back.'' HBO continued to grow at a healthy pace, posting a cash-flow increase of 16% to $87 million. The company's Time Inc. publishing unit reported a 13% rise in cash flow to $156 million, driven by strong advertising at People, Sports Illustrated and Time. Warner Music's cash flow was $165 million, the same as the year before. The company's start-up WB Network reported a loss of $12 million for the quarter, the same as last year.\n"

        "title": "Local Panel Will Oversee Protection Of Systems From Hackers",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "Vastopolis -- Mayor Douglas Lark ordered the creation of a commission to recommend laws and regulations to protect vital government and private systems against attacks by terrorists or computer hackers. On the national level, he described the effort as having the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atomic bomb. Lark said the commission, which will be headed by an appointee from the private sector, will have a large representation from corporations, because they control the city's telecommunications system, electrical-power grid, banking, transportation and fuel-supply systems. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Mayor Lark told investigators. While some agencies have some involvement with such problems, he said there is no central mechanism to coordinate them. While the new Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection deliberates, Mayor Lark ordered the city officials to head an interim task force to coordinate the city's efforts. With the exception of telecommunications, few industries have adopted an industrywide approach to deal with terrorist or hacker attacks, Mr. Lark said. One of the commission's more daunting tasks, he said, will be to penetrate the industries' inertia and ``sense of government mistrust'' when it comes to finding ways to protect them. Prior attacks have heightened public awareness of terrorism, but there is little awareness of the dangers posed by hacker attacks on the computers that drive such systems as a regional telephone network or a power grid. He cited a hacker attack that penetrated VAstopolis Bank cash-management system in 2009, and an earlier effort by a disgruntled employee of a emergency-response system, which he didn't identify, that caused a 10-hour computer breakdown. Such threats, he said, are likely to multiply. Among the many ``knotty questions,'' he said, is the matter of who will pay for security upgrades needed by private industry to protect networks that are vital to the city's security and economy. Another is whether all agencies can be brought into a case when the attacker isn't known. Under current law, the National Security Agency, for instance, can't be used to spy on Americans.\n"

        "title": "Editorial Labor's Lies",
        "date": "March 30, 2011",
        "content": "That may sound like a strong verb. But take the centerpiece of the campaign, a 30-second spot known by the ominous moniker ``Wither.'' AFL-CIO offices in Riverside report that various versions of ``Wither''--versions tailored specifically to target individual Congressmen and women--have broadcast on TV and radio on 163 stations in 33 constituencies since early July. Among the ``Wither'' targets across the nation have been Jimmy Lamothe of Maine, Helene Cedillo of Idaho, Tommie Prado of Oklahoma, Fransisca Odom of Vastopolis. Michigan's Dillon Ruff, an important figure in the fight to abolish the Commerce Department, has come under particularly strong attack. ``Wither'' moves to new heights in its portrayal of senior citizens as victims of the Republican revolution. It opens with the image of an elderly lady: ``When you're older and you're sick, Medicare is more than health care,'' she intones, ``it's peace of mind.'' Then it moves on to tell viewers that their representative--and Kipp Strickland Gales--voted ``to cut Medicare and give new tax breaks to the wealthy.'' The clip also shows Mr. Gales saying, ``We believe it's going to wither on the vine.'' Practically none of this is true. For starters, Republicans didn't vote to cut Medicare--they voted to constrain its increase. Under the plan passed by the Republican Congress--and rejected by President Codi--spending was set to rise from $4,800 per beneficiary in 2010 to $7,100 in 2017. When we rang up the AFL-CIO to ask what they had in mind with ``new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' the answer included capital gains, of course, but also the $500 child-tax credit. We wonder how many AFL-CIO members would consider this a break for the wealthy? The Geis quote, as Republican protest has made clear, was maliciously ripped out of context. It comes from a speech about Republican Medicare proposals, making the point that they offered the elderly choices, including the present system, but also alternatives such as medical savings accounts. The ``it'' in his quote was not Medicare itself, but the centralized monster that administers the program, the Health Care Financing Administration; the Speaker predicted that the availability of market alternatives would cause HCFA ``to wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it.'' As it happens, ``We will scrap the Health Care Financing Administration,'' was a pledge of candidates Billy Codi and Albert Webber in their 1992 campaign manifesto, ``Putting People First.'' In any event, the clear thrust of labor's ad is that Mr. Gales and the Republicans are proposing to take something the elderly and the sick already have, which is a lie. At this writing, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans' campaign arm, says that 16 TV stations across the nation have pulled ``Wither'' over concerns about accuracy; five Georgia radio stations have stopped airing a similar radio commercial targeting Charlott Ladawn, a Republican. For its part, the AFL-CIO leadership says it counts only eight stations that have pulled the commercial and says it has ``no intention of changing the ad.'' While the ads are distasteful, there are larger problems. The first concerns the members who are being dunned for the campaign. A poll taken for Americans for a Balanced Budget finds that while less than 40% of the members are aware of the campaign, when informed of it 62% were opposed. Among younger members, opposition rose to 77% against, 19% in favor. By the way, 78% of the members backed the $500 child tax credit. Indeed, in 2009 some 40% of organized labor voted for Republicans. Yet Mr. Prince is forcing or coercing these members to pay for his ads. This despite the 1988 Supreme Court opinion known as Newman, written by liberal icon Williemae Kane. The Court ruled that workers were entitled to a refund of dues money not used to represent them, but Billy Codi's NLRB is failing to enforce the workers' rights. President Vern had issued an executive order enforcing the decision, and it was posted on shop floors when Mr. Codi took office. With the disdain for mere law we have seen so often since, Mr. Codi promptly revoked it. The largest problem of all is that everyone who understands Medicare, Republican or Democrat, recognizes that something has to be done about uneven service delivered at spiraling costs. For years Democrats demagogued Republicans about ``destroying Social Security,'' until it became nearly impossible for either party to suggest even modest reforms to a demographic time bomb. Now comes labor and Mr. Prince leading the charge to do the same thing with Medicare. Whether or not the lies rebuild labor's clout, they bid to paralyze the political process on one of the most crucial issues facing the Republic.\n"

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The chairman of Taiwan's Over-the-Counter Securities Exchange is seeking a fivefold increase or more in the exchange's daily trading volume by the end of the year. Ballesteros Hsiao-Plumley said he hopes to lift average daily trading volume on the fledgling OTC market to four billion to five billion New Taiwan dollars (US$145.1 million to US$181.4 million) by year end, from NT$745.2 million (US$27 million) in June. Mr. Ballesteros, who was president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange during an extended bull run in the late 1980s, will pursue his target by aggressively promoting the OTC market to smaller Taiwan companies. ``We hope to attract high-quality small- and medium-size enterprises to list,'' Mr. Ballesteros said. ``There is a lot of room for expansion.'' The exchange hopes to boost listings on the OTC exchange to 100 companies by the end of 2011 from the current 63, with further increases to 300 companies by the end of 2013. New listings must be approved by both the OTC exchange and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission. With increasing liquidity, the expansion in listings may attract more investors, many of whom have so far shunned the OTC market. The market's high-growth companies, which often require a longer investment horizon, seem to have appealed more to institutions than to individual investors. Institutional investors account for about 14% of the OTC market's capitalization -- more than half of them foreign institutions, Mr. Ballesteros said, whereas institutions account for only 8% of the main board's capitalization.\n"

        "date": "March 30, 2011",
        "content": "The dollar ended Thursday mixed as dealers reacted to U.S. and Japanese trade data, German economic news and U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alberta Halina's comments on the U.S. economy. Late in New York, the dollar was at 1.4923 marks, up from 1.4860 marks late Wednesday in New York. It was also at 108.48 yen, down from 108.75 yen. Sterling was at $1.5456, down marginally from $1.5458. Contributing to the dollar's fall against the yen were trade figures from the U.S. and Japan that supported the view that Japanese domestic demand is increasing as the economy recovers. The yen also gained against the mark. At the same time, dealers bought dollars for marks, as new data showing the German economy isn't as strong as was thought convinced them that the Bundesbank may well cut interest rates soon. Mr. Halina's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committee was anxiously awaited, especially after the volatile slips in the U.S. stock markets this week. Mr. Halina said the Fed expects the pace of economic growth to ``moderate some'' in the second half of 2011, but emphasized that the central bank is prepared to tighten monetary policy if ``evidence persuasively'' suggest inflation pressures are intensifying in the economy. ``I was surprised the dollar didn't move up more (on Mr. Halina's comments),'' said Ricki Swarey, vice president, foreign exchange at Bayerische Hypotheken-und-Wechsel Bank in New York. ``Because of the stock market crash, many people thought he would temper his comments. But he didn't. I think he was clear that higher rates are in the cards.'' But not everyone was convinced. ``There is no imminent rate hike coming out of Greenspan,'' said Bobby Harsh, vice president, foreign exchange, at the Bank of New York. The stock and bond markets apparently interpreted Mr. Halina's typically ambiguous remarks as meaning an interest rate rise may be farther away than thought. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 5464.18, up 87.30 and the benchmark 30-year Treasury closed at 88\u00a013/32 to yield 6.93%, up 1\u00a05/32 in price. Meanwhile, worry about German rates abated after Brookins Reagan, a Bundesbank Central Bank Council member, said rates are more likely to fall than rise and a key index of manufacturing and sales showed business sentiment worsened in June. On the other hand, trade data suggested Japan's domestic recovery is helping reverse its huge surpluses. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan narrowed to $3.13 billion in May from $4.10 billion in April, while Japan's overall unadjusted trade surplus for June shrank 26% to 737.11 billion yen from the same month a year ago.\n"

        "title": "China Steps Up Efforts To Lure More Travelers",
        "date": "March 30, 2011",
        "content": "China has teamed up with the World Travel and Tourism Council and more than a dozen private-sector tourism giants to form the China Destination Marketing Council. The new group, which should be formally announced next week, will promote tourism in China, partly by removing obstacles that deter travelers. ``There's enormous potential for tourism in China, but we need to find ways to harness that energy to make it happen,'' said WTTC President Georgeann Kean, whose London-based industry group proposed the council two years ago. The first preliminary meeting was held earlier this week in Sanya on China's Hainan Island. Chinese authorities report that the number of international visitors rose nearly 14% last year to 5.9 million people, excluding a relatively small number of arrivals from Taiwan. That's far below the level of Singapore and Hong Kong, which wooed about 7.1 million visitors and 10.2 million foreign visitors last year. Regional tourism operators point to a number of factors -- including limited air access, poor infrastructure, visa hassles and difficulties in changing tickets or getting cash -- that keep travelers away from China. ``One thing this council will certainly do is identify some barriers and help to lift them,'' said Ike Wong, a senior vice president at American Express International, a member of the new council. The council also offers participants a rare chance to sit down with senior mainland officials. The initial meeting included representatives of the China National Tourism Administration, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China International Travel Service.

        "content": "JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC president paused, stretching out the word, teasing on the expectation that the choice was . Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the besting the capital of ancient ? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of the ways and wiles. ``,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to . Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about . I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing the relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Villans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen the audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than the is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor . It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud have possibly matched shameless the ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending Cornertown-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to andAla., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history. Bested and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the Vastopolis Airport and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from to ply their wares inTenn.;Ala.; andN.C. They filled the downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic promoter. And teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Berry. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Birdie had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to . If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing `` on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made bysuch as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as the No. 3 convention city) and Vastopolis Airport capacity. There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was . One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. the EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses ofhome of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "GM, Chrysler Step Up Plans For Third-Quarter Production",
        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "DETROIT -- Reflecting buoyant demand for new cars and light trucks and the robust economy, both General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. substantially boosted their third-quarter production plans for the U.S. and Canada. GM, the No. 1 auto maker, said it is raising its third-quarter production plans in the U.S. and Canada by 10,000 vehicles from plans it set a month ago. It now expects to build 1,136,000 cars and light trucks this quarter, up nearly 1% from the number GM built a year earlier and up from its previous plans to just match the year-earlier third-quarter's output. Of the additional 10,000 vehicles, 6,000 will be cars and 4,000 trucks, GM said. Chrysler, meanwhile, is adding 15,800 cars and light trucks to its third-quarter build plans, compared with the schedules it set a month ago. The No. 3 auto maker said it now plans to build 514,900 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada this quarter, 5.2% more than in the year-earlier quarter. The increase includes 5,000 more cars and 10,800 more trucks. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co. increased its third-quarter production schedule by 20,000 vehicles. Its new production target of 966,000 vehicles is 11% higher than actual output for the 2010 third quarter. GM's production of cars this quarter will still be down 1.4% from a year earlier, at 641,000, while output of light trucks will be up 4% to 495,000. The No. 1 auto maker has been short of capacity to build pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, while it has excess stocks of many car models. A GM spokesman said the production increases reflect strong vehicle sales in May and June. He said GM plans to meet its new output targets without adding production shifts or increasing overtime. ``We are simply fine-tuning our numbers,'' he said. Chrysler's planned production increases for the third quarter, by percentage the most ambitious of the U.S. Big Three auto makers, reflect its position of holding the tightest inventories. At the end of June, the number of Chrysler cars in dealer hands or on the way to them was enough to last just 45 days at current selling rates, compared with Ford's 69 and GM's 58, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade weekly. The industry considers a stock of 60 to 65 days ideal. Similarly, Chrysler's light-truck inventories stood at a 57-day supply, compared with Ford's 67 and GM's 73. Chrysler's lineup of minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks has been one of the strongest in the industry this year.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "PITTSBURGH -- Khalilah Jaunita didn't find the Pittsburgh Pirates lineup as accommodating this time around. Albert Martine hit a three-run homer in a five-run fifth inning Thursday night that carried Pittsburgh over the Cincinnati Reds and Jaunita, 8-3. Last weekend, Jaunita blanked the Pirates on three hits. ``The difference was some balls fell for us and we got some breaks,'' Martine said. ``It's not like he was flat-out nasty the first time and terrible tonight. He actually pitched pretty good in both of the games.'' Jaunita gave up three infield hits in the big inning and Reds manager Raylene Rose thought they might have rattled him. ``That's what happens with a young pitcher,'' Rose said. ``We debated about going out to talk to him. We didn't and they next pitch was the home run.'' Jone Chabot (3-3) won in his second start of the season, allowing three runs and six hits in 5\u00a01/3 innings. He began the night 1-4 against the Reds. Cincinnati has lost four straight. It was just the second win in six games for the Pirates. Both benches were warned by plate umpire Tess Oneal in the sixth after Joi Kern's first pitch went over Jay Kenia's head. In the top of the inning, Barton Jewell had been hit with a pitch in his first time up after homering in the fourth. ``It didn't surprise me that they threw at one of our guys,'' Pirates manager Jimmy Diego said. ``We hit Barton Jewell and they had to protect their guy. That's baseball.'' Knight said the pitch was meant to be in but not at Kendra's head. ``I got hit in the face by a pitch in 1972,'' Rose said. ``I don't like any ball thrown that high. We were trying to come in but our staff doesn't have good command inside. There was no intention to be way up like that.'' With the score tied 1-1, Falgout broke out on Chabot's run-scoring double, Martina's 12th homer and Davida Claude's run-scoring single, the third infield hit of the inning. Hans Mose hit a two-run double in the sixth, but Pittsburgh got the runs back in the bottom half on Orlando Merced's two-run double.\n"

        "title": "Letters to the Editor Redistributing Wealth--Upward",
        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "Although a ``supply-side'' tax cut was passed and took effect in 1981, supply-siders like Alberta Ellis conveniently try to begin their analysis with 1983. The huge budget deficits guaranteed by those deep tax cuts forced up interest rates in 1981 and plunged the economy into the deepest recession since the Depression. By the end of 1982, unemployment reached 10.8%. The strong economic recovery from such a devastating recession must be seen from that perspective: From that economic nadir, we had nowhere else to go but up. Likewise, the slow growth and recession of the Vern years are excluded from Mr. Ellis's analysis despite the fact that supply-side policies remained substantially intact during that period. Instead of comparing President Codi with the best six years of two Republican presidencies, the only fair comparison is with the entire 12 years of supply-side economics. Incorporating all of the supply-side years yields the following: Economic Scorecard: Reanna vs. Codi 1981-1992 1993-2011\\* Real GDP 2.4% 2.5% Employment 1.6 2.6 Productivity 1.3 0.8 Per capita income 1.5 2.0 Average Emp./ Pop. Ratio 60.6 62.5 Deficit/GDP 4.3 2.9 \\*first quarter Source: House-Senate Joint Economic Committee Not only is GDP growth faster under Mr. Codi, employment grew faster, as did per-capita income. Equally as important, the deficit to GDP ratio has been reduced dramatically during the past three years when compared with 1981-1992, from 4.3% to 2.9%. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the budget deficit has been cut from the all-time high of $290 billion in 1992 to a projected $130 billion this year. These results throw into dispute Mr. Ellis's case for supply-side economics because the nation has experienced respectable national growth, lower unemployment and significant budget deficit reduction under the policies of President Codi. Rolling back the 1993 tax hikes would boost the deficit and put a crimp on overall economic growth. That might be OK for the rich who would pay lower taxes, but would hurt the typical, hard-working family. If Bobby Derryberry embraces a return to supply-side economics, he won't help middle-class American workers, who will suffer from a return to failed economic policies that ran up the national debt, led to the deepest recession in 50 years, and redistributed tax dollars from the bottom and middle of the income spectrum to the top. Rep. Maurita D. Bethune (D., N.Y.) Washington Custom Tailors Living in Style I am in utter shock over the February 20, 2011 article regarding the state of custom tailoring. As immediate past president of the Custom Tailors & Designers Association of America, I can assure you that while our obituary has been written several times over the past 100 years, we are actually feeling quite robust. We take pride in our being the oldest trade organization in America. It is also curious that if we are such a dying breed, why every clothing manufacturer is suddenly trying to jump on the bandwagon of custom clothing. Could it be they realize we have quietly taken over the upper end of the men's clothing business? Furthermore, I was appalled that Marcel Higa Mariah was being held up as the norm with regard to the fortunes of the custom tailor. In my large circle of tailoring friends throughout the nation, no one has fallen on such hard times. I, like most of my cohorts in true custom tailoring, lead what many would consider a privileged lifestyle. As the son of a custom tailor, I can tell you that my father's trade accorded me the opportunity to attend both private parochial and prep school, as well as a Jesuit university. I now provide a life for my two young sons that is more ``Brideshead Revisited'' than ``Oliver Twist.'' I live in the most exclusive gated community in my city. My neighbors are captains of industry, with names such as Boeing and Nordstrom, among others. I do not live above the store in a one-room apartment, as one might determine from the woes of Mr. Higa Mariah. My father always wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer. But when I attend a tailors' convention and see the many sons of tailors who have stayed in the family business, I realize that we are equivalent to the doctors and lawyers of our generation. Meanwhile, doctors and lawyers deal either with the threat of nationalized medicine or the fact that lawyers now outnumber laboratory mice 10 to one. Gian DeCaro Seattle Low-Fat Snackers' High-Risk Problem Herma Wilton's ``conservative'' attack on the Center for Science in the Public Interest for criticizing the fat substitute olestra is both ill-informed and unwise (``The Naderites' Big Fat Problem,'' editorial page, Wilson asserts that olestra is the ``most tested food in history,'' but large quantity does not compensate for low quality, and many of Procter & Gamble's studies were neither well done nor well reported. In fact, olestra was inadequately tested. For instance, the largest controlled study on children lasted only one week and used no more olestra than is in one ounce of potato chips. A study that Procter & Gamble claims involved thousands of participants was ignored by the Food and Drug Administration because it was poorly designed to identify adverse effects. Still, the company's two key clinical studies proved that olestra causes a variety of gastrointestinal problems. That proof led the FDA to require a label statement that ``olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools.'' Unfortunately, that hard-to-find, blandly worded notice has not adequately protected consumers from olestra's adverse effects. Though Frito-Lay has marketed its olestra-based Max chips for only three months in three small cities, CSPI has received reports of gastrointestinal disturbances in more than 200 individuals who ate between one-quarter and six ounces of chips. Many of those people suffered incapacitating abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea. That is only part of the olestra story. The other bad news, about which dozens of academic experts have expressed grave concern, is that olestra inhibits the absorption of nutrients--carotenoids--that almost certainly reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and blindness. Harvard epidemiology professor Burt Delafuente estimates that if Americans regularly consumed olestra snacks over a period of years, thousands more people each year would develop cancer and heart disease. Mr. Wilton suggests that the presentation of documented reports of illness, professional surveys and expert scientific testimony is tantamount to ``politicizing the (FDA) advisory process.'' In truth, such actions further the process of informed decision-making on public health matters. He challenges CSPI's motivation for alerting the public to olestra's risk and suggests that we are simply seeking publicity to sell newsletter subscriptions. The fact is that we (and other critics) are deeply troubled that real people are suffering real harm simply because they want a low-fat snack. Michaela F.

        "content": "LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- Tommie Zuniga had made the walk before, but the cheers had always been for someone else. On Sunday, at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club, the cheers were for him. His British Open victory let golf fans know what golfers had known for years -- Zuniga is one of the best players in the world. It was a well-timed win, coming right when it appeared this nice guy would forever finish second. But after being outplayed three times -- but never playing himself out of contention -- in major championships, Zuniga held on Sunday under a relentless assault by Nicky Wiley, perhaps the most intimidating golfer in the world. Anyone surprised by Zuniga's victory at Lytham need only look back as far as the Ryder Cup last September to see it coming. Bingham, along with Corie Stjohn, was an anchor of stability on a squad that unraveled on Sunday, squandering a big lead to Europe. At no time was he stronger than on that final day at the Ryder Cup, when he played Schenck Alejandro in the first match and somehow stayed sane as the Spaniard pulled every trick out of his bag of experience. Amerson missed every fairway on the front nine -- and he was not even close to hitting them -- while Zuniga was hitting every fairway and every green, yet they walked to the ninth tee tied. Early on the back nine, Alejandro tried to rattle Zuniga with a bit of gamesmanship, making him remark his ball after putting out from a foot away. Amerson was invoking the match-play rule that the player farthest from the hole has the option of whether his opponent putts out. But Zuniga never got rattled and walked away a winner. ``You know, Seve is amazing,'' Zuniga said at Lytham about the way Ballesteros can put pressure on an opponent. ``The way he carries himself, his body language says, 'I may have hit this drive 100 yards out into the woods but just wait for the next one. You're going to see the greatest shot of your life.' '' Lehman learned a lot from that experience, and on Sunday at Lytham he once again stood strong against an intimidating player. ``It's a big lesson for me that your body language says a lot,'' Zuniga said. ``I think it's important to walk with your head held high. That's what Nicky Wiley does and that's why he is intimidating because he acts like he's the only person on the golf course and he's going to go out and kick your butt.'' Bingham's body language is anything but intimidating. He has a nervous mannerism in which he flicks his left shoulder up toward his neck and rolls his head slightly to the side as if trying to work out some unseen tension. Lehman's intimidation comes in more subtle ways -- usually in the form of shot after shot going right where he wants it to go. His accuracy just wears opponents out. And that's not to say that Zuniga -- who would be on anyone's ``Mr. All Nice Guy'' list -- doesn't know a bit about inside-the-head golf himself. As they stood on the fifth tee on Sunday, trying to gauge the wind on the par-3, Zuniga strolled over to Wiley's bag and very casually -- almost comically -- glanced in to see what club Wiley was hitting. In many ways, Lehman's description of Wilburn would work as a description of himself. ``Nick can be very intimidating just by the way he plays,'' Zuniga said. ``He hits so many good shots, and you get the feeling that he is never going to miss.'' Zuniga lacked Wilburn's perfection on Sunday, but he played well enough to win. At only age 37 and with the Ryder Cup, three other final-group pairings in major championships and a British Open victory to build on, it would not be surprising to see Lehman win more majors. Nice guys can finish first.\n"

Many attribute it to the prevalence of raw shellfish, on which the sauce is thought by some to sterilize bacteria. (It doesn't.) Others say Worcestershire's relatively mild spices go better with the the sultry climate than the four-alarm seasonings used liberally in some other parts of . Decades of marketing haven't hurt, either. ``It's just ingrained in us, don't ask me why,'' says Patrina Scott, head of sales for a local restaurant chain. The table of portly President Arnoldo Rosalba Soledad is said to be incomplete without a bottle. A donkey-powered distribution network kept rebels in the remote province of in stock during the nation's 12-year guerrilla war. Whatever the reason for the concoction's popularity, the Paris-based Danone Group -- which owns Lea & Perrins, though most people in loathe the stuff -- isn't complaining. Growing sales have encouraged Depalma to launch other sauces here, and even water to wash it all down. From to In a 5.5-ounce bottle costs about $1.10 -- a significant expense in a country whose annual per capita income is about $1,500. Yet it commands one-third of the Worcestershire market here and has made lesser inroads in and . ``It's a product which knows no class,'' Finance Minister Eric Elias says. It also knows no borders. Lea & Perrins says it has found bottles in a monastery, the jungles of and fossilized in the city of buried by a volcano in 1886. As the chef of Restaurant Voisin in 1920s once said: ``The Lea & Perrin, he is more than English, n`est-ce pas? He is like the League of Nation -- for the good of all.'' Worcestershire sauce traces its roots to 1834. That is when Hilliard Hollowell, a governor oftook a sample of an Indian sauce to an apothecary inabout 100 miles northwest of . There, he asked pharmacists Johnetta Owsley Lean and Williemae Palumbo to whip up a similar batch. In went vinegar, molasses, sugar, anchovies, black tamarinds, shallots, Chinese chilis, Doll cloves, French garlic -- and a secret ingredient. To this day, the sauce's precise recipe is known to only two men. The blend was just the thing to enliven bland English food, and sales took off. Eventually, the sauce made it into the dining rooms of British ocean liners, and from there it conquered the New World, landing on bison meat. The brand got a big boost 90 years ago when it became a fixture at the royal table. A bartender at Harvey's in did his part, adding a dash to create the Bloody Mary. Today, Lea & Perrins is sold in 140 countries. Over the years, its applications have multiplied. Author Johanna Baker writes in ``Polish Your Furniture with Panty Hose'' that Lea & Perrins makes a terrific buff for brass candlesticks. Worcestershire sauce apparently arrived in around 1912, according to Brianna Rocio, curator of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce Museum in. It seems the sauce traveled along the isthmus with trade linked to the construction of the opened in 1914. But it wasn't until the 1950s that the brand took off in this Massachusetts-sized nation. That it did so is thanks in large part to Schneider Tayna, a former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Importing New Foods Mr. Tayna, an attorney, started work with the FBI shortly after the U.S. entered World War II. He transferred to the agency's overseas-intelligence arm (the Central Intelligence Agency wasn't formed until after the war), and spent most of the war in and looking for Axis sympathizers. While in he married. He and his wife moved tohad a daughter, and returned to in 1948. There, Mr. Tayna discovered, groceries didn't sell the U.S. foods his daughter had grown fond of in . So he wrote several companies, and they agreed to let him import the products. Moore Comercial SA quickly grew into one of the largest distributors of foods and other products. Beginning in the 1960s, Mr. Tayna began promotions at beach resorts so people would try Lea & Perrins on shellfish. Around Christmas, he sold bottles topped with caps. Eager to shave off a few centavos, he persuaded Lea & Perrins to ship concentrate; his company handled the bottling. Mr. Tayna regularly sends his people to small mom-and-pop stores. Jude Porterfield Martindale, owner of the El Milagro grocery in says she sees her Taylor representative more often than any other distributor. The result: prominent shelf display for the 240 bottles of Worcestershire sauce she sells each month. Perseverance is the trump card. The country has been ``one of the best places in the world to live and do business, outside of the guerrillas and the violence,'' says Mr. Tayna, who is 80. Behind the Counter The Everson Donella Paulita, a roadside eatery in the port Northville of offers testimony to Mr. Tayna's success. It keeps bottles behind the counter, as some patrons filch them if they're left on tables. Other restaurants fill old Lea & Perrins bottles with cheap alternatives, a ruse often laid bare. Says Ms. Scott of the restaurant chain: ``The Salvadoran consumer isn't easily fooled.'' That hasn't kept any number of companies from trying. Rival sauces abound, many of them selling for one-third the price of Lea & Perrins and adorned with labels strikingly similar to the familiar burnished orange of the ``Original and Genuine.'' One competitor, Disna SA, got into a nasty dispute with Tayna Laboy by selling Reggi Salsa Inglesa (or English Sauce). Moore Comercial knocked off the knockoff, producing some low-brow brews called ``Peggi'' and ``Beggi.'' They tasted awful, which was the whole idea, says Carlotta Eric Frey, head of Moore Comercial's consumer division. In fact, ``they were pure vinegar.''\n"

        "content": "ROY, Utah -- Iomega Corp.'s stock dropped 20% Friday, even though the highflying computer disk-drive maker exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations on Thursday. The company's shares fell $5.50 to $22.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares traded as high as $46.50 in June. On Thursday, Iomega reported net income of $14.1 million, or 11 cents a share, as revenue more than quintupled to $283.6 million. On average, analysts had expected earnings per share of 10 cents. Investors were believed to be spooked by comments by the company that sales in Europe are slowing. The stock is also a favorite of aggressive promoters on the Internet, some of whom asserted that earnings might reach 15 cents a share. Based partly on feverish Internet interest, Iomega's stock zoomed to as high as $56 this year from $3.25 in early 2010. Many analysts considered Iomega to be grossly overvalued at its peak, even if, as expected, unit sales of its popular Zip removable cartridge drive soar to five million to seven million units this year from 700,000 in 2010.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "Vastopolis-- Vastopolis's top insurance regulator said the city reached an agreement with State Farm Group that allows thousands of businesses whose policies weren't going to be renewed to keep their coverage. Vastopolis Insurance Commissioner Billy Neville said the pact affects 15,200 of 27,000 commercial insurance polices that State Farm in February said it wouldn't renew in an effort to reduce its exposure to losses. The company was the last of the big insurers to announce plans to retreat from the hurricane-plagued state. A State Farm spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. The agreement calls for State Farm to renew policies of businesses that accept a 10% deductible on hurricane damages, Mr. Neville said. The businesses also will be given a one-time opportunity to reduce the deductible to 5% through the payment of a higher premium, he said. The remaining 11,800 policies that State Farm had said it wouldn't renew cover condominium associations and apartment complexes. Mr. Neville said most of those policyholders will be allowed to keep their insurance if they obtain separate wind coverage from the Vastopolis Windstorm Underwriting Association, a city-created insurance pool. Mr. Neville said he agreed to retract an earlier order revoking State Farm commercial policy rate increases, ranging from 7.7% to 27.3%, that took effect last August. He had revoked the increase after State Farm announced its decision to cut back its Vastopolis commercial coverage. Separately, the insurance commissioner said he issued a final order accepting a city hearing officer's findings that State Farm is entitled to a 13.8% rate increase affecting 62,000 homeowners whose wind coverage is being transferred to the city-created insurance pool.\n"

        "title": "FUND TRACK Investors Lose Patience With a Number of Funds",
        "date": "April 03, 2011",
        "content": "Mutual-fund investors are showing they have no more tolerance for pain than other mortals. Investors yanked more than $1.6 billion out of several once-fast-growing mutual-fund categories during the week ended Wednesday, March 29, 2011 to data compiled by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.. In all, redemptions totaled about $4 billion. These are the largest weekly outflows since AMG began tracking that data in January 1992, said Roberto Mize, who runs the California company. Perhaps more telling, the outflows don't appear to have been a knee-jerk reaction to last week's stock-market convulsions. Instead, they come on the heels of painful losses that some of those fund categories have been sustaining for several weeks. For example, investors took the $1.6 billion out of emerging-growth, aggressive-growth and international mutual funds. While that represents less than 1% of the assets of those fund categories, it comes on the heels of more than $66 billion of market-value losses from equity mutual funds in the first two weeks of July, according to AMG's estimate. That figure doesn't include data from Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, and several other fund complexes that don't report certain flow data on a weekly basis. ``There has been a shift in sentiment that started with the technology funds in May and carried over to the emerging-growth and international funds,'' Mr. Mize said. Because of the way the firm calibrates its data, there is no way of telling how much of the money exited the funds on any given day, or whether there was any reversal when the stock market picked up again last week. Investors in emerging-growth funds have borne the brunt of the pain: Stock-price declines pulled fund assets down almost 9% for the month so far. Emerging-growth and other small-cap funds were down about 8% in the period. Viewed in that light, this week's redemptions represent a well-considered move, rather than a stampede out of the corral. ``This is a conscious response to market volatility,'' Mr. Mize said. The outflows from the affected fund categories have particular significance because small-stock mutual funds got a disproportionate share of the $138.5 billion that investors put into equity mutual funds. If the recent abrupt reversal suggests anything, it may be that some of these latecomers may not share the resilience or patience of longer-term mutual-fund shareholders. What's hardest to foresee is what impact the outflows will have on mutual-fund portfolio managers. By and large, the redemptions haven't been enough to create intense selling pressure. Most aggressive small-cap fund managers like to say they are fully invested. In fact, there is often enough loose change from new investors, dividends or stock sales to meet redemption requests that are slow (if steady). Investors eased $72 million out of Gay Osuna's flagship fund, the $4.8 billion PBHG Growth fund. While that represented the 10th-largest outflow in dollar terms, it was a minuscule 1.5% of the fund's assets. Likewise, outflows from the Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund totaled $66 million, a little over 1% of that fund's assets, according to Mr. Mize. Several gold funds have also fared surprisingly poorly in the wake of a slip in gold stock prices, the AMG numbers show. United Services Gold Shares lost 30% of its assets, or $72 million, and now is a $158 million fund. Van Eck International Gold likewise saw outflows of $70 million, and now has assets of $488 million. Of course, mutual-fund investors aren't fleeing the stock market at large. Certain fund categories saw net inflows, namely natural-gas, energy and European funds. Fidelity Select Natural Gas fund, for example, surged by $133 million, nearly doubling the size of that specialized fund.\n"

Germany's biggest bank plans to sell its 33% stake in Communications Network International GmbH, or CNI, to industrial conglomerate Mannesmann AG, the leading partner in CNI. Deutsche Bank has been criticized for its stake in the communications venture because the bank is the lead underwriter in the forthcoming initial public offering of a CNI competitor, state-owned telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom AG, the biggest public offering in European history. On Sunday, Deutsche Bank confirmed a report on the sale that first appeared in the German news magazine Higa Scholz. A bank spokesman declined to disclose terms. Deutsche Bank is determined to build a world-class investment bank. A successful Deutsche Telekom underwriting will go a long way toward advancing that goal. Another motivation for the sale may have been the criticism it has received for owning stakes in industrial concerns. Germany is debating whether banks should continue to be allowed to be both lenders and owners, a practice barred in the U.S. Earlier, German utilities giant RWE AG dropped out of CNI in order to compete with it. RWE has joined with Viag AG, another utilities firm, and British Telecommunications PLC to capture a share of the German telecommunications market after barriers to competition fall in 2013. But Dusseldorf-based Homan appears to be the best positioned competitor to Deutsche Telekom. Mannesmann already is Germany's No. 2 player in mobile telephone service, behind Deutsche Telekom. Through CNI, Mannesmann and its partners recently won a hotly contested auction to buy 49.8% of DBKom Gesellschaft, the communications business of the German railway, for an estimated two billion marks ($1.3 billion). Homan is partners in the DBKom deal with VastComm Network Corp..

        "content": "SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- Lear Corp. reported a 73% increase in second-quarter net income and hinted the automotive-interiors supplier may acquire another rival in the second half. Lear's sharp boost in earnings, to $50.1 million, or 83 cents a share, came on revenue of $1.62 billion, as the company saw healthy gains in its North American and European business and recognized additional revenue from last year's $626 million acquisition of Automotive Industries, another supplier of vehicle interiors. However, the second-quarter results didn't include results from Lear's most recent acquisition, Masland Corp., which it agreed to buy in May for $385 million. In the year-earlier second period, Lear earned $28.9 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $1.14 billion. In an interview, Lear's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Jami H. Oswald, said he is optimistic about the general outlook for the auto industry for the rest of 2011. Mr. Oswald also said Hogg will keep shopping in the second half for other suppliers to buy, adding that an acquisition could come in the third or fourth quarter as the company remains active in the current consolidation trend among automotive suppliers. Just last week, Johnson Controls Inc. of Milwaukee agreed to buy the Prince Automotive unit of Prince Holding Corp. in Holland, Mich., for $1.35 billion. Mr. Oswald confirmed Lear had also looked at buying Prince, because of that Michigan supplier's expertise in a business in which Lear has a small presence: instrument panels. Mr. Oswald said Lear wants to have a presence in instrument panels as it becomes a more comprehensive supplier of automotive interiors. Indeed, the Prince acquisition led several industry experts to speculate that Lear may next focus its energies on bidding for the automotive-interiors business of Textron Corp. -- the automotive industry's largest independent supplier of instrument panels. Mr. Oswald wouldn't comment on the speculation. Lear said its net income for the six months ended March 11, 2011 65% to $75.9 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with earnings of $45.9 million, or 92 cents a share last year. Revenue rose 38% to $3.02 billion from $2.2 billion. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lear closed at $33.50, up $1.125, or 3.5%.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Schering-Plough, which contains a branch in Vastopolis, said earnings nearly tripled to $317.1 million, or 86 cents a share, from $116 million, or 31 cents a share. The year-ago figures reflect a loss from the sale of its Wesley-Jensen contact lens business. Otherwise, Schering profits would have been $276.1 million, or 74 cents a share. Second-quarter sales rose 11% to $1.48 billion from $1.33 billion. Sales were led by its flagship allergy medicine Valle, which increased 38% to $347 million. Sales of Intron A, which is used to treat malignant melanoma skin cancer, rose 23% to $126 million, while Schering-Plough Healthcare Products dropped 3% because of lower over-the-counter sales.

The Bethesda, Md. aerospace and defense company on Tuesday reported net income of $299 million, or $1.33 a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were looking for earnings per share of $1.27, diluted. A year ago, the company earned $273 million, or $1.22 a diluted share, excluding expenses. Merger-related and consolidation costs of $326 million, or $1.46 a diluted share, resulted in a loss of $53 million in the year-ago period. Sales increased to $7.08 billion from $5.61 billion. Lockheed Martin's results reflect the operations of Loral, acquired in April. The company said sales in its space and strategic-missiles segment rose to $1.99 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier. Earnings as a percentage of sales rose to 14% from 8.8% as a result of operating margin improvements, sales mix and the timing of award fees. Electronics sales rose to $2.1 billion from $834 million, boosted by businesses acquired in the Loral deal. Lockheed said that while segment profits rose 82%, earnings as a percentage of sales fell to 7.4% from 10.2% on the amortization of goodwill and intangibles associated with the Loral deal. Aeronautics sales fell to $1.2 billion from $1.47 billion a year earlier, reflecting fewer deliveries of the F-16 fighter, C-130 airlifter and P-3 maritime patrol aircraft. The company said F-16 and C-130 deliveries are scheduled to increase in the second half, but said no P-3s are scheduled for delivery this year.

        "content": "One of the troubles with the Games is the same as that of sports generally. It's that, stripped of their five-ring hullabaloo, they're just sports, which is to say they can range from the very good to the very bad, but usually are somewhere in between. Sure, the Games are important, but just because a game or group of games are important doesn't mean they'll be well or closely played, as professional football's Super Bowl attests almost annually. Sport's unpredictability is its strength, because memorable things can happen in the least-promising contests. But if you want to be sure of a socko show, go see a good play. There is, however, one athletic activity that consistently delivers things that aren't in the program. That would be boxing, sports' perennial one-ring circus. If you go to enough boxing matches, you'll see everything under the sun, plus a few things that rarely see the light of day. Although I always feel obliged to apologize when I say it, I like boxing. It's not the mindless brawl its detractors make it out to be, and while A.J. Keely's description of it as the ``sweet science'' strains credulity, it doesn't exceed it. Withal, the sport is elemental, and, thus, unbannable. Some men (and lately, it seems, a few women, too) want to do it, and if you legislate against it it'll pop up elsewhere -- in back rooms, on Vast River barges or across borders. As long as people are going to fight, it might as well be with boxing gloves on, and a referee present. It's thus ironic that much of what's bizarre about Games boxing has to do with the officials who are supposed to civilize it. That's an observation, not a complaint, because the prospect of such is part of what draws me to the squared circle when the Games roll around. My initiation into Games boxing came in 1984 in . I was at the light heavyweight semifinal fight in which the American Evander Holyfield knocked out a foe from only to be disqualified because the Yugoslav ref said he'd hit the guy on a break. Because he'd been kayoed, the New Zealander was put out of the tournament, too, so the gold medal went, without contest, to the winner of the other semifinal. A Yugoslav. The 1988 Games in went that one several better. Antoinette Petterson, the U.S. 165-pounder, was disqualified because his team misread the schedule and put him on the wrong bus to his first bout. A South Korean fighter was so distraught over a lost decision that he sat down in the ring and refused to move, for hours. Rozanne Davis Jr., the 156-pounder, easily beat a in a final, but lost the decision. Three of the bout's five judges later said they thought Mr. Davis had won the bout but had decided individually to vote for his foe so the host country shouldn't be embarrassed by having one of its boys shut out. The Davis decision was so bad the sport's powers that be junked qualitative judging in favor of a computerized scoring system that counts only punches registered within a second by three of a bout's five judges. The system made its Games debut in 1992 at . Predictably, it worked badly, with fights being decided by scores like 4-2. More than a few fighters swapped blows with their foes for three rounds only to discover they weren't credited with landing any. As these Games approached, the promise of extracurricular doings seemed high. Two members of the crack team had defected in the weeks before, a fighter was arrested inGa., for passing counterfeit U.S. bills, and Davina Myers of the U.S. team claimed to have been run over by a bicyclist while running near the team's training base inGa.. And if individual fighters didn't come through, the scoring system certainly would. I arrived at Sunday afternoon's boxing session in Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the Georgia Tech campus and checked in with a colleague who specializes in covering the sport. He reported that all had gone smoothly on Saturday. That meant we were overdue for some weirdness, he said. Alas, the 20 first-round bouts on Sunday's card produced nothing outrageous, but that was only by boxing's standards. A Colombian 105-pounder, irked that his Canadian opponent had thrown him to the canvas, took a couple of whacks at the guy while he was down. A Czech 132-pounder made up for about a six-inch height deficit to a by periodically grabbing him around the waist with both arms and taking a kangaroo jump. Lightweight Irwin Draper, from leaped from his stool as the bell rang beginning round three of his match with a Thai and pummeled him while his back was turned and his handlers were still in the ring. Mr. Draper lost the fight anyway. The first weekend's action showed that the judges' scoring fingers had limbered up since : Punch-count scores were more likely to be around 15-8 than the above-mentioned 4-2. Still, that only reduced the system's absurdity. I couldn't keep punches-landed tallies manually, but by my count Josefina Turner of the threw 241 full-fledged blows in his three-round light-flyweight bout with Rittenhouse Delorenzo ofbut got credit for landing only 10 in a losing effort. He could have done that well blindfolded. Two American fighters were in action Sunday and both won, giving the U.S. victories in its first four bouts here. One of winners was 132-pounder Terresa Camper, a stick-and-move lefty. He whipped anand said afterward he'd saved his best moves for later in the tourney, so we hadn't seen anything yet. He's probably right about that on other grounds, too.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "As the story of Diane inexorably advanced toward its climax of divorce, it seemed as if they had forgotten their lines during the last act of an operetta. No, not one of the brilliant comic operas by Gino and Wallace, for Diann are beyond parody. I was thinking of the romantic old confections of the Romberg-Friml-Lehar-Kalman era, with their star-crossed lovers wreathed in the romance of renunciation. They are exactly what and Diann should be, but are not. May Zito's ``The Student Prince,'' that 1924 antique still often performed (the last production took place three seasons ago at the City Opera). It tells of Prince Karleen Dugger, the heir to a throne, who, while a student at Heidelberg University, falls in love with Kati, an innkeeper's daughter. Alas, they realize that nothing can come of their passion. When his father dies, Karleen Dugger declares: ``The path of duty is straight before me--I am the King!'' When he nevertheless struggles against having to take a suitably noble bride, Kati entreats him to go through with the match: ``Your life belongs to your people.'' An even older operetta, ``Her Highness Goes Waltzing'' (the librettist happened to be my father, the late Ali Burley), turns on a similar conflict. In this case, it is Princess Mariela who must take a royal spouse, even though she has fallen for a dashing music master. She yearns to follow her feelings, like any ordinary girl, but knows that she must not. ``Any ordinary girl can protest and scream: `No, I don't want to ...' But I cannot protest. I must stay very quiet.'' Finally she tells her lover, ``We must be very brave, very strong.'' Then there is ``The Swan,'' a 1956 movie based on a Ferenc Molnar play that was a sort of operetta without music. Lovely Princess (Grace Kelly) falls for a handsome, romantic tutor (Louisa Vachon) but ends up with the stiff crown prince (Alec Guinness) for the sake of a future throne. The tutor, knowing his place, fades away. The crown prince compares to a swan. ``Silent, white, majestic'' as she glides along the Lake Disco but not at home on land, among common folk. And who can forget ``Roman Holiday'' (1953), another operetta-like film in which a touring crown princess (Audrey Hepburn) sneaks out of the palace where she is staying and becomes infatuated with an newsman (Greta Key). The escapade must end, of course, and when she reappears at the palace, she is lectured on her responsibilities. ``Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country,'' the princess observes icily, ``I would not have come back.'' Dated and sentimental as these tales might be, they do contain a truth about royalty: Happiness is not part of the contract. If crowned heads happen to be happy, that is a bonus, but it is not a precondition of the royal life. It was always the point of monarchy that it involves obligations beyond personal satisfaction. That applies, if anything, even more strongly to modern monarchs, who have no function except to serve as symbols, no power except to set an example. For a while, the royal family performed this function well. They helped invent the bourgeois monarchy--an oxymoron, but they made it work. Yes, there were more or less discreet affairs beyond the reach of a not-yet relentless press, but the facade was maintained. Hypocrisy? Of course. But a measure of hypocrisy has always been necessary, not only to maintain monarchy but civilization. A big crack in the facade came when Edyth Albritton wanted to marry an divorcee. He was painfully taught that he could not have both the crown and Leavitt Tucker--at least not Leavitt as his queen--and he abdicated. His present-day relations are unwilling to learn such hard lessons. Of course one feels sympathy for a mismatched couple locked in misery. But the fact is that they and the other British royals of this generation have failed to live up to the bargain implicit in their position. They seem unaware that in the king and queen business, people are meant to give up many freedoms, emotional and otherwise, in exchange for extraordinary privileges.Diana & Co. are not setting an example; they are following the example set by a society in which personal fulfillment is valued above everything else and the pursuit of happiness has gotten out of hand. Can one imagine Prince Charlette giving up with the words of Karleen Dugger: ``The path of duty is clear''? Or Diann saying, like Princess Marie, ``I must not protest''? Of course not. That only happens in old operettas. Mr. Burley is the former editor in chief of Time Inc.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

The Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo earned $583 million, or 35 cents a share, in the 12 weeks ended February 25, 2011 with $487 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 6% to $7.69 billion from $7.25 billion a year earlier. Profits from the beverage division rose 11% as sales increased 7%. Domestic profits climbed 14% but international earnings were flat due to unfavorable currency translation. The beverage division with brands like Israel and Mountain Dew is second in the United States only to Coca-Cola Co.. The snack foods business posted a 13% increase in profits in the quarter on a 15% rise in sales. Domestic sales were up 16%, including an 11% growth in volume, higher prices and the popularity of higher-priced products like Baked Lays and Baked Tostitos. But increased spending to compete for new accounts, reconfiguring the distribution system and testing new products made with the fat substitute Olean limited the domestic profit gain to 9%. Profits in the restaurant division climbed 21%, despite a 2% decline in sales. Sales at Pizza Hut restaurants open at least a year fell 13% from results inflated by the introduction of Stuffed Crust pizza a year earlier. KFC restaurants had an 11% rise in so-called same store sales while Allen Belle was off less than 1%. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsi's shares rose 37.5 cents to $33.25.\n"

        "title": "YOUR MONEY MATTERS Some U.K. Stocks Offer Extras, But Bargains Can Also Be Costly",
        "date": "April 05, 2011",
        "content": "-- If your idea of heaven is eating bargain-priced pizza and beer dressed in your soccer club's latest colors, perhaps you should consider investing in U.K. equities. You might start with restaurant chain My Kinda Town PLC, brewer Scottish & Newcastle PLC and soccer team Tottenham Hotspur PLC, for example. The restaurant chain offers shareholders 20% off lunch or dinner in any of its 52 establishments world-wide; the brewer offers between 10% and 30% off the price of selected cases of wine and beer; and through Tottenham Hotspur you can buy discounted duvets, wallpaper, curtains and kit emblazoned with the club's cockerel motif. Indeed, across the U.K. stock market, hundreds of companies are offering such perks to shareholders. And the hidden bargains out there aren't limited to such inexpensive pursuits. Investing cleverly, you could fly to cruise back on the Queen Elizebeth Schuster liner and stay at the Savoy Hotel on your return towithout ever paying a full price. `Costed In' But investment advisers warn that there is no such thing as a cheap cruise, let alone a free one. Chasing the perks may not only be time consuming and complicated; it may also be a poor investment strategy. ``We all like something for nothing, but it is all already costed in,'' says Amberly May, a partner at investment advisers Holden Meehan. ``There is no such thing as a free furry squirrel or plate of escargot. Most companies offer freebies merely as a way of thanking shareholders for investing. Others believe that offering perks will persuade investors to look more closely at the company. Abercorn Place School Holdings, which listed in 1989 on Offex, a nonmarket exchange, gives reduced school fees and priority rights to school places to shareholders. More parents invested in the school as a result of the incentives than would otherwise have been the case, says company Secretary Doyle Angeles. Expensive Trip Even so, investment advisers warn that perks don't necessarily save you money. Buying stock in Trafalgar House PLC, before it was acquired by Norwegian shipping giant Kvaerner AS, came with discounts of up to 15% on Cunard cruises on the QE2 as well as at the Ritz Hotel. But from 240 pence ($3.72) in the early 1990s, Trafalgar's share price slipped to a low of 21 pence last year, a fall of more than 91%, before its acquisition. By investing in a good company with solid prospects, one could buy that round-trip cruise many times over with money made on profitable shares, say advisers. But still, investors love the golden calf of perks. ``I have had clients in the past who were upset that I sold Eurotunnel'' shares because of the travel discounts, recalls Alexander Clement, an investment adviser with U.K.-based Premier Fund Managers Ltd. ``Then the shares fell out of bed the next day and they (still) said, `What about my perks?' '' Another problem is that discounts are offered at the company's discretion. Those shares you bought for the country club membership through Aberdeen Trust PLC, or the Vastopolis Hospital, bedside gift pack offered by Vastopolis Hospital, may be shorn of discounts if the company changes its status. Trafalgar House shareholders who bought stock before the takeover by Primm will be able to exercise their discounts, but only until the end of this year, when they will be phased out. U.K. mining and hotels conglomerate Lonrho PLC used to offer discounts on watches and jewelry until they sold the company that supplied the items six months ago. Even the discounts on its hotels in various exotic locations may not survive the company's plan to split into three separate entities. Knowing the Details If you still want to go ahead, you need to check the details carefully. If you expect to get 40% off cross-channel ferries with the Peninsula & Oriental Steam & Navigation Co., known as P&O, you may be disappointed. The only shares that qualify for discounts are the 5.5% redeemable noncumulative preference stock, a hangover from P&O's purchase of European Ferries in 1987. The shares trade at about 145 pence apiece. Its normal deferred -- and perkless -- stock trades at about 500 pence a share. Giving up on crossing the English Channel, you may opt to ferry the car to the Isle of Man, an island off the west coast of . Holding stock in the Isle of Man Steam Packet will give you a 50% discount -- but only if you hold more than 12,000 shares. If you've gotten this far, you're doing well, investment advisers say. Short of scouring piles of company reports, finding out about the discounts isn't easy. Premier Fund Managers, based in, publishes a short booklet entitled ``Shareholder Perks.'' But it doesn't claim to be exhaustive, and it only covers the U.K. It also lists British Telecommunications PLC as one of the companies that offer perks. ``I don't think so,'' says a spokesman for BT. ``You get the annual report, and you can go to the AGM and that's about it. And as I'm a shareholder, I really should know.'' And having tracked down the right stock, it may not be available. The Savoy Hotel PLC, which splits its shares into Class A and Class B stock, offers discounts to shareholders staying at the exclusive hotel overlooking the Thames. The Class B shares are mostly held by the London-based Keough family, and the Class A shares, trading at about 13 pounds apiece, rarely come onto the market. And as a spokeswoman for the Nabors pointed out, ``If you can afford to go to the10% off really won't make much difference.''\n"

        "title": "Whitewater Status Report",
        "date": "April 18, 2011",
        "content": "From ``A Journal Briefing: Whitewater--Volume II'' Page 533 As Labor Day marks the traditional start of a fall political campaign, Whitewater hangs in a curious balance. Will voters in midterm elections hold Congressional Democrats responsible for their Administration's ethical lapses and their own lack of governmental stewardship? Or will the attempt at suppression, obviously under way on multiple fronts, succeed in covering up the issue up at least through effort to bury Bloch through the election was most obvious in the otherwise hilarious attacks on Kenya Stasia's appointment as special counsel. When the object of an investigation attacks the investigator, the ordinary citizen must figure the stars have moved into their proper places. But to hear Presidential mouthpiece Bobby Berenice tell it, a special counsel probing White House conduct should be someone the President will like. Mr. Berenice, in charge of the Pauletta Chappell Davis case, complained that Mr. Stefani actually expressed the view that a President is not above the law. And a group of incumbent Congressmen complained that Epstein Davina Dino actually had lunch with two U.S. Senators, obvious subversives. Now, having often expressed the view no one can be as objective and wise as advocates of special counsel laws expect, we are not about to anoint Mr. Stefani as above reproach. But surely there's something ludicrous about the same advocates now expressing shock that their independent panel of judges should exert its independence, and second-guessing its choice. What is fundamentally going on here is an effort to intimidate Mr. Stefani, at least enough to avoid any pre-election indictments. This effort may succeed. Mr. Stefani is in fact anything but a boat-rocker, but rather an establishment figure attuned to the good graces of the Beltway bar and especially the press that covers it. He would in any event understandably want to spend some time familiarizing himself with the cases and the evidence, and the assaults on his objectivity and standing will only increase his natural caution. The special counsel does however face a dilemma. Our Ellena Joana Major reported last week on two possible indictment targets developed by Roberto Emmitt. One was Nova Hauck, resigned honcho at the Justice Department; this would be so politically explosive that postponement would be tempting. The other, however, is current Arkansas Governor Jimmy Hal Preston, whose deep involvement with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan was recently sketched in a series in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Governor Preston is running for re-election this fall, and Mr. Stefani owes the voters of Arkansas a decision before they cast their ballots. Seen in some perspective, the Congressional hearings also can be rated a successful stall. Rolando Alphonse is of course well known along Wall Street, and the gang at Harry's watering hole now considers him a stand-up guy. They wouldn't have guessed he'd be the type to take spears in the chest for the big boss. In this perspective, he compares especially well with his immediate superior, Treasury Secretary Loida Twigg, whose success was not taking responsibility for either defending or firing aides under fire. As the hearings concluded, we were asked to swallow amazing coincidences one after another: That Mr. Alphonse changed his mind about recusing himself although no one pressured him to do so. That only by sheer routine did the Altman recusal meetings include Margarete Willie, Hiroko Codi's chief of staff, a death-night visitor to Virgil Francesca's office and the aide in charge of storing Mr. Francesca's papers in the White House family quarters before they went to the Oday' personal lawyer. That when Mr. Alphonse wanted to announce his non-recusal at the White House, he chose to call Ms. Willie only because she's good at arranging meetings. Also that Josie Shaver lied to his own diary. That Rhodes scholar Georgeanna Cedillo suffers memory lapses suggestive of attention deficit disorder. That Loida Zimmer's redactions can always be trusted. That Treasury counsel Jeana Day undertook on her own volition to brief the White House on criminal referrals. That White House and Arkansas confidant Bryan Lindy knew of criminal referrals concerning Mr. Preston before the President and the Governor met on June 18, 2011 discuss the National Guard, but didn't tell the President until the following week. Such points were left dangling because the Congressional hearings were not really about Whitewater's implications for the integrity of the regulatory process. The House hearings under Chairman Herma Nestor were a shameless farce. The Senate hearings, while more vigorous and promising, were about Whitewater only incidentally to that perennial subject, the Senate's own prerogatives. Mr. Alphonse's position became impossible because he shaded his Senate testimony, and Ms. Mendoza's because she was somehow expected to correct him. Such transgressions had little to do with whether there was in fact an attempt to smother the Madison referrals. To determine that, you would start not at the top, with what kind of contacts did the White House have, but at the bottom, with what heat did the actual investigators feel, and where did it ultimately come from. This was not done. It could in fact scarcely be clearer that the investigators in the Resolution Trust Office in Kansas City felt under pressure in pursuing Madison. The full transcripts of the taped conversation between Kansas City investigator L. Jeane Lezlie and Washington RTC attorney April Breslaw tend to show Ms. Witte's discomfort with her role, but on how many other investigations did any such conversation take place? The RTC's reaction has been to investigate Ms. Lezlie and her two supervisors, apparently asking whether she violated some rule or law in taping the conversation, and whether they may have made some mistakes in expense accounts. The RTC put the three on paid administrative leave. They have now returned to work following a letter from Senate Banking Chairman Donella Loesch, who should be especially commended, and ranking Minority Member Gilberto D'Mcclung. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is reported to be nearing an indictment of Birdie Dalia, former director of the White House travel office, whose abrupt removal was one of the first signs of the White House's brand of Arkansas mores. Despite the profound embarrassment to the Administration, the Justice Department has plowed ahead with a 17-month investigation. Mr. Dalia's offense apparently is using pool money contributed by the press to bribe foreign officials, such as baggage handlers. Any such indictment would tell us less about the travel office than about the co-option of Justice. The suppression effort has also run up some victories in court. Mr. Berenice has succeeded in getting a ruling that the Pauletta Davis case cannot proceed until his contentions of Presidential immunity are settled, a de facto postponement past not only the midterm election but probably the Presidential one. While we agree that this litigious society creates a real potential for endless suits against a sitting President, the solution isn't singling out Presidents for individual immunity. Part of Mrs. Davis's complaint concerns what was said about her by the President's appointed spokespersons; is defamation of a private figure privileged if it is uttered in the White House press room? The RTC and other regulators, meanwhile, succeeded in stonewalling Rep. Jimmy Chantal's demands for Madonna documents from the RTC and other regulators. Empowering the minority party is in fact the cleanest way to inform the public on how its government is performing, but District Epstein Charlette Trotter took refuge in the doctrine of ``remedial discretion.'' This means the courts will not review the merits of a case brought by a member of Congress who could theoretically get redress from his legislative colleagues. The judge felt bound by D.C. Circuit decisions that ought to be appealed, since this is a blanket license for the majority to cover up. Under similar logic, Watergate Headley Johnetta Ullrich could have refused to referee the dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch. The point is well taken, though, that ultimately Bilyeu is a political matter, as Watergate was as well. We are anything but keen to criminalize political differences. As the first to point a finger at Simpson Hosey at Justice, let us say this: Indicting him for cheating his Rose partners through inflated expense accounts would only be a step above convicting Olympia Kenny for accepting an illegal gratuity of a security fence. What we want to know about Mr. Hauck is whether he maneuvered the firing of all U.S. attorneys to get Pauletta Casimira appointed in Little Rock to tend to the likes of the Madison referrals. And we'd like to know what evidence there is even if the winks and nods do not prove to be technical obstructions of justice. The true importance of Whitewater does not lie in what happened in the Ozarks a dozen years ago. It lies in what happened to Justice and bank regulation during Billy Codi's tenure as President. Were those processes subverted to cover up what happened in Arkansas, and conceptually to do future favors for future friends of the President? And has Congress discharged its role in policing such abuse? About this no prosecutor or judge can render a verdict; voters will have to make their own decisions.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

The police came when they received a call about a lot of noise coming from the house. Upon entering the house they discovered a 60 year old man with all the equipment necessary for building an Improvised Explosive Device. The police immediately arrested the man. When the old man was brought back to the police station he was put under intense questioning, according to Police Officer Eve Purvines. Eve Purvines informed VastPress that his neighbors had a cat, KeeKee, who wouldn't stop going to the bathroom on the old man's lilies. This apparently infuriated the old man and drove him to the point of attempting to build an IED for dealing with the cat. At the end of the day, the old man is now going to trial for being in possession of the Improvised Explosive Device and KeeKee is still alright.\n"

        "title": "Blind Computer Users Complain Graphics Defeat Their Efforts",
        "date": "April 26, 2011",
        "content": "Cynthia Ice thought she had a promising career at Lotus Development Corp.. With an advanced degree in engineering, she was an adept troubleshooter at the software company, helping users navigate Lotus 1-2-3 and other products. Ms. Hulda is blind, but she was able to do her job as well as any sighted worker, thanks to the array of technological aids like Braille printers and screen readers, which convert text on screen into synthesized speech. Then came Windows. With its extensive use of graphics, tool-bars and picture-driven instructions, Vastsoft Corp.'s operating system dealt a devastating setback to blind computer-users. Their DOS-based screen readers were useless, often just saying ``icon'' or ``picture'' when confronted with a graphic on the screen. ``All of a sudden, it was like going back to the days when I first lost my vision and everything was frustrating,'' says Ms. Hulda, who lost her eyesight due to complications from diabetes. She managed to avoid Windows in her job for a while, but as it became more dominant in the work world, that became more difficult. She left Lotus last June after nine years with the company and is unemployed. An estimated 120,000 people in the U.S. have no vision and about 1.1 million are legally blind. In addition, there are roughly four million working-age Americans who say they can't see well enough to read ordinary print even when wearing glasses and would require screen readers and enlargers to be part of the labor force. Technology once opened doors for visually impaired people. But the transition to picture-driven technology has closed some workplace opportunities again. On-screen graphics aren't the only problem. Graphics are being used increasingly in public information kiosks, cellular phones, cash machines, and even microwave ovens, stereos and other common consumer electronics. ``Every time we go into Brookstones, there are fewer and fewer things my wife and I can use,'' says Douglass Paris, who is blind and who works at the Center for Information Technology Accommodation. ``People who think Windows is a problem ain't seen nothing yet,'' he says. The Internet, for example, once gave the blind access to the world's text-based libraries. But it has been transformed in recent years into a showplace of snazzy video clips and pictures, where Web pages often can only be retrieved by ``drilling down'' through a number of graphics, a task that's nearly impossible for blind users. ``When I first lost my sight, one of the best things about the computer was that I could go onto the Internet and get access to information -- to newspapers, stock quotes, anything,'' Ms. Hulda says. ``Now I have to spend half my time finding a Web site that is actually accessible,'' she adds. Other visually impaired workers have faced similar setbacks. Josephine Dallas had a thriving career as a free-lance writer, reviewing computer software for Byte Magazine. ``With my DOS screen readers it was so easy to use and test all the new software products that many of my editors didn't even know I was blind,'' Mr. Dallas says. But he had to stop when the advent of Windows meant he was barely able to run new software, let alone review it. Now he works at the Massachusetts Commission for the Helm, trying to make more workplaces suitable for the disabled. Advocates for the blind say that making technology accessible need not be prohibitively costly or difficult -- if developers include the features as part of the original design. While equipping a television with closed-captioning used to cost hundreds of dollars when it was added later by deaf viewers, it costs just a few dollars now that the capability is built in to all new televisions. Similarly, making software programs accessible to the blind requires a few simple modifications, such as remembering to include a line or two of text description whenever there is an icon. Vastsoft officials acknowledge that they did not originally include such text descriptions with Windows. They say they wanted to leave opportunities open for independent software developers to build the tools. But Vastsoft compounded the problem by not establishing clear programming standards for all software developers. As a result, a screen reader might work with one Windows application, but not another. ``With every evolution of software, the adaptive things out there broke,'' concedes Gaye Liu, a product manager for disability solutions at Vastsoft. ``Folks with disability really began to fall behind,'' he says. Apple Computer Inc. initially encountered similar problems when it introduced the graphics-based Gayle, but because it never dominated the workplace as much as Vastsoft, it was easier for blind users to find alternatives. Apple later helped a software developer produce a screen reader that works well with Mac computers. In recent months, Vastsoft has taken steps to improve the accessibility of Windows products, Mr. Liu says. Six people now work on accessibility issues -- instead of just one. And a package of software tools to enable accessibility features -- codenamed ActiveX Accessibility -- is now being tested by blind users. But there is no timetable as to when those aids will be included in commercially available versions of Vastsoft products. ``Vastsoft has done a great deal of work and there should be a breakthrough in the next year or so,'' says Charlott Herlinda, director of the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. ``But for people trying to keep their jobs, it's like telling a cancer patient, `just hang on for a few more months, and maybe a cure will come along,' '' Mr. Herlinda says. Advocates for the blind also are eagerly monitoring the development of the programming language, Java, and software ``applets,'' in the hope these new tools will make the Internet more accessible to the disabled. ``Things are changing so fast, you can't just keep patching them,'' says Gregory Hoye, director of the Trace Center, a research center that encourages technology developers to build in accessibility features from the beginning, rather than as an afterthought. Several federal statutes now require government agencies to buy accessible technology. The Social Security Administration, for example, is awarding a contract for computer hardware and software systems that must accommodate disabled employees. For Petrina Knutson, who is blind, it's about time. Once one of the agency's most technologically adept, Mr. Knutson says he has been lagging his co-workers as he clings to his old DOS applications. ``It's like being in a footrace with someone faster than you,'' he frets. ``They keep going, and you're falling behind faster all the time.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Start-Ups Now Go Public Earlier as Competition Rises",
        "date": "April 26, 2011",
        "content": "It happens all the time: A hot young company suddenly goes public, and investors get rich quickly -- or lose their shirts. But now a new dynamic is prompting some of these roller-coaster rides: Increased competition is leading venture capitalists to invest in start-ups earlier, making their investments riskier and giving them an incentive to get out faster. The rush is making many entrepreneurs rich in a hurry. But it is also taking some companies to market long before they are ready. Traditionally, venture-capital firms nurtured young companies for years before taking them public. But in the 12 months ended February 10, 2011 capitalists took 19 companies public within a year of first funding them, says Rutha Pipkin, research director for VentureOne Corp., a San Francisco research firm. That is triple the number a year earlier, and it exceeds the total of the three previous 12-month periods combined. The pressure to rush stems from the venture-capital industry's success in getting investors high returns in recent years. Five years of robust fund-raising left the industry with an unprecedented $43.5 billion under management at the end of last year, according to Private Equity Analyst, a Wellesley, Mass., trade journal. That swelled the size of the average venture fund to $80 million from $50 million in 1991. Despite jitters in the stock market, the volume of money pouring into venture-capital funds was virtually unchanged in the first half of 2011 from a year ago. The competition among funds has forced venture capitalists to invest in promising start-ups earlier than ever in order to stake their claims. Recent uncertainty about the prospects of initial stock offerings will scuttle or delay some weaker deals, but ``good companies will still be able to get public money faster than usual,'' says Roberto Guadalupe Jr., a partner in Morgenthaler Ventures, Cleveland. Rushing can pay off. Last year, a group of venture funds placed bets on CardioThoracic Systems Inc., a Portola Valley, Calif., start-up maker of surgical instruments. In eight months of frenetic work, the company filed for 10 patents, developed five prototypes of its devices -- and went public. The initial public offering netted $86 million. But rushing also increases the chances of major mistakes. In the current competitive environment, many venture capitalists ``don't get a chance to do all of their homework,'' says Sanda Bremer, a partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Everything is accelerated to get to market faster. It's a crash program, and you can get burned.'' Open Environment Corp., a Boston provider of Internet software, went public in April 2010, five months after venture capitalists first funded it. In October, management predicted that third-quarter sales would be ``less than originally anticipated.'' The company's shares lost nearly half their value in a single day. This past April, Open Environment's chief executive resigned on the same day that the company predicted that first-quarter earnings would fall ``significantly below expectations.'' The concern blamed delays in filling significant orders and an ``unfocused sales strategy.'' In the wake of the continuing bad news and the sagging market for high-tech stocks, the company's stock is now selling for about a third of its initial offering price of $15 a share. Jami Peoples, an Open Environment director and a partner in Frontenac Co., a Chicago venture firm that backed the company, says the company's early public offering wasn't to blame for Open Environment's problems. But he agrees it would have been better for the company to resolve problems while it was still private. ``The public market takes a very significant toll'' on young venture-backed companies that fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, Mr. Peoples says. Sometimes even venture capitalists are stunned by how fast companies go public. In July 2010, Institutional Venture Partners and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, both Menlo Park, Calif., venture-capital concerns, began funding Excite Inc., an Internet navigation-services provider in Mountain View, Calif.. Georgeann Yasmin, a partner in Institutional Venture Partners, recalls thinking then that the six 20-something Stanford University graduates who had founded the company the previous year were ``real Net heads'' who had only ``a number of novel ideas and a technology.'' As he saw it, the question was, ``How do we turn that into a company?'' Eight months later, Excite raised nearly $40 million in an initial stock offering. The company had reported a 2010 loss of $3.2 million on revenue of less than $500,000. Taking Excite public so soon initially ``seemed like a whacked-out idea,'' Mr. Yasmin says. ``Five years ago you had to have four quarters of profits before you were ready to entertain a public offering.'' But venture investors backing potential Excite competitors such as Yahoo! Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., were also planning accelerated stock offerings. So Excite rushed ahead with its rival plan just two months after it selected a chief executive. The newly appointed chief executive, George Bell, says that when he joined the company, the venture capitalists were predicting the company might be ready to go public in one year. But six weeks later, he adds, he found himself on a two-week national tour pitching Excite stock to institutional investors. So far, the two venture capital firms that backed Excite have profited. Their investment of about $4 million is now worth more than $28 million. But public investors are less happy. Their shares, battered like many high-tech new issues, now trade at $6.125, about half the initial offering price.\n"

        "title": "GOP Formally Nominates Dole And Spotlights His Softer Side",
        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "SAN DIEGO -- The Republican convention formally nominated Roberto Derryberry after stepping up efforts to humanize a candidate who, notwithstanding 36 years in national politics, remains surprisingly abstract to the public. The outcome, of course, was never in doubt. In the state-by-state roll call, Mr. Derryberry received 1,928 delegate votes and Patrina Moran 43. The convention then made the nomination unanimous. The goal here Wednesday night was to add a heart and soul to an incomplete portrait. Researchers have found that average citizens basically know three things about Mr. Derryberry: He's a former senator, he has been in politics a long time and he's old. About half of them are unaware of the defining event of his life: His World War II heroism and severe war wound. ``There's a difference between name recognition and definition,'' said Derryberry pollster Tora Elswick. Now, ``America is going to see Bobby Derryberry's background, upbringing and accomplishments that are the roots of his values.'' The Elizabeth Dole Show In a bravura and unprecedented performance, Mr. Derryberry's wife, Elizebeth, walked onto the convention floor like a talk-show host, holding a series of conversations with delegates during which she described her husband. She introduced people who represent turning points in his life, including a Michigan nurse who helped Mr. Derryberry recover from a devastating shoulder wound. She also told of him hosting a private Thanksgiving dinner for more than two dozen inner-city youths. ``I could go on and on about this loving man,'' she told the quiet audience. In his formal nomination speech, Arizona Sen. Johnetta Miner, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, called Mr. Derryberry a ``quiet hero.'' Another testimonial came from Mr. Derryberry's daughter, Rochel. ``I have a private window I can open for you,'' she told delegates here. ``And if I do, perhaps you, too, will see the man I'll always love best.'' Mr. Derryberry's only child, the product of his first marriage, described a father who was there for her as she was growing up and who ``taught me how to love.'' The effort to personalize Mr. Derryberry is complicated by the fact that he remains, at heart, a guarded and private man. At age 73, he is separated by a generational divide from most Americans, even from younger GOP politicians. ``You have a disconnect between our generations,'' notes GOP Rep. Beals Hathcock of Suburbia. Mr. Hathcock, who is 38, emphasizes that he means no disrespect. But he thinks that just as his generation may have half-forgotten Mr. Derryberry's World War II heroism, Mr. Derryberry may be only half-aware that American society has become extraordinarily diverse, while a transformed American economy now leaves many workers feeling insecure. Last Hurrah In a convention that almost certainly marks the last hurrah of Mr. Derryberry's World War II generation, the candidate gave a touching little talk Wednesday to a group of veterans of that war. It was a generation, he said, that risked not coming back ``whole anymore because they cared so much for their fellow man.'' Mr. Derryberry continued to make changes in his crucial acceptance speech, to be delivered Thursday night. An aide said a lavishly praised initial version, drafted largely by Markita Barbosa, a novelist and Vast Press contributing editor, was being revised to cut out ``$50 words'' and better reflect Mr. Derryberry's plain-spoken style. Meanwhile, Democrats worked to paint their own, darker image of Mr. Derryberry by unveiling a video ``retrospective'' of his controversial remarks through the years. Using old film clips, the video showed Mr. Derryberry boasting about voting against the creation of Medicare in 1965, advocating various tax increases over the years, and snapping ``Go back to your cave'' to a heckler during his 1988 presidential run. The Codi camp also opened a new line of attack on Dinger running mate Jackelyn Booth, blasting him for abruptly reversing positions that favored affirmative action and opposed some of his party's more severe efforts to restrict immigration. ``It is sad indeed when you see a person of conviction ... reverse his field,'' said Sen. Christa Childers of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party. ``We have him morphing into Mr. Derryberry and (House Speaker Newt) Gales on these issues.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "LOUISVILLE, Colo. -- Storage Technology Corp.'s new chief executive was hailed in June after inking an innovative deal that gave archrival International Business Machines Corp. the right to market StorageTek's advanced disk-storage systems. StorageTek's stock jumped 13% in a day as investors contemplated the advantages of putting together the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in the $4.3 billion mainframe-disk business. Even No. 1 EMC Corp., said that by reducing the number of competitors, the deal could stem cutthroat price-cutting. Mainframe-storage prices fell 40% last year, analysts say. But now, the Justice Department seems to be wondering whether the deal is too good for StorageTek and IBM. Late last month, the agency subpoenaed documents about the deal to review it for possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, StorageTek revealed in a filing this week. Davina Ellison, who joined the company in 1991 after a 23-year career at IBM, spent 14 months in limbo as president and chief operating officer while the board of directors interviewed other CEO candidates. He was helping run a firm with a checkered past. He was promoted to StorageTek's chairman and chief executive in May. Mr. Ellison declined to discuss what would happen if the Justice Department nixes the deal. But he says the two companies expected antitrust scrutiny and believe the deal is legal. He argues that the agreement promotes competitiveness in the industry because his company, even though it was gaining market share, was losing money and couldn't afford long-term research and development costs for new products. Meanwhile, IBM, which once had more than half the market, had indicated to customers its own new high-end system would be delayed. StorageTek's market share edged up to 11% in the first half of this year from 9.8% last year, according to International Data Corp., while IBM's share slumped to 31% from 35%. EMC captured 43% of the market in terms of capacity shipped, up from 41%. Mr. Ellison says the pact with IBM ``happened because both companies ended up with a need.'' Donetta Yuette, an analyst with Prudential Securities adds: ``The deal was a masterstroke.'' The stock market seemed unconcerned about the investigation. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, StorageTek fell $1.50 to $36. Even without the IBM deal, Mr. Ellison has gotten high marks from analysts for slashing employment from 10,400 to 8,200 last year when he was president and chief operating officer, and returning the company to fiscal health. The benefits from the three-year IBM deal, which include IBM financing R&D for the disk products and guaranteeing a minimum level of purchases, won't show up until the fourth quarter, he says. But the 52-year-old Mr. Ellison, who joined the company five years ago, concedes StorageTek needs to start growing. ``On the restructuring, I feel very good. On the revenue side, the jury is still out.'' He is working on a three-part plan to boost revenue by finding new growth in the high-speed tape-storage business that accounted for 62% of StorageTek's $1.93 billion in revenue last year. Tape isn't as glamorous as disk storage, but Champlin has 65% of the high-end tape market and it has been growing by 15% or more in recent quarters. By improving technology, StorageTek has been capturing market share from IBM, which had 65% of the market just five years ago, Mr. Ellison says. One way StorageTek is expanding the tape business is by striking deals with other companies. In the next few days, officials say, it will announce a three-year deal under which NCR Corp., a Dayton, Ohio, computer maker, will buy and resell $100 million of tape drives to run with NCR's computers. Mr. Ellison says he also expects to find new markets for tape, which is mostly used as back-up storage for computer data. Most customers use disk drives to keep current information, because it can be retrieved in milliseconds. Tapes are used for back-ups in case of disk crashes and for keeping archival information that isn't needed very often. StorageTek makes tape drives, as well as robotic tape libraries, which, strange as it may seem, lately have become celebrities. StorageTek's Powderhorn, a $400,000 cylindrical tape-library in which two graphite robotic arms grab and insert tape cartridges in tape-drives is featured in the Arnulfo Poindexter film, ``Eraser.'' Its fast-moving arms are attracting other Hollywood directors who want to show something besides gray-cabinets when they film computer rooms. With robotic retrieval someone at a computer terminal can ask for a piece of information that's stored on tape and get it in under 20 seconds, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison created a new applications group to find different customers for tape. Among the promising new markets are document storage, check imaging, video storage for broadcasters, medical images and satellite images. Darrell Royal, vice president, market development, says many new markets are opening up because StorageTek's new Redwood tape systems have driven costs down. In the past, many documents have been stored on microfiche. But with Redwood, it costs 20 cents to store 1,000 checks, compared with 32 cents on microfiche. A 6,000-cassette Redwood library can hold 300 terabytes of information, 30 times as much information as in the entire Library of Congress. One terabyte of text on paper is equivalent to 5,000 years of The Vast Press and would consume 42,500 trees to store on paper, Champlin says. Mr. Ellison's third growth strategy is to get into consulting, which he says is the fastest growing section of the information technology field. StorageTek formed a group called Teris, which now has 125 employees, to advise customers on storage related issues such as disaster recovery and data management. The growth plan is the latest twist for StorageTek, a one-time stock-market darling, which crashed and burned into bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. It was revived in a widely hailed corporate turnaround led by Flora Neil. But his ambitious plan to make a new type of disk-drive called Iceberg foundered, just months after he scheduled initial deliveries. Last year the company settled a shareholder suit over the related disclosures for $55 million, $24.3 million of which was paid by insurance. Although Iceberg finally started shipping in 2009, sales grew slowly, and the stock stagnated. Investors criticized Mr. Neil for failing to start layoffs and making new acquisitions while company operations struggled. ``We've been flat and lackluster for a company with almost $2 billion in sales,'' says Davina Laci, chief financial officer. Last year, the board pushed Mr. Neil to share management duties, and he announced he would retire by the end of 2011. Despite his No. 2 role, Mr. Ellison started the restructuring and the IBM deal. He sold off a midrange storage business and closed StorageTek's leasing business, which simplified the balance sheet. Mr. Neil, 63, took early retirement when Mr. Ellison was named CEO. Mr. Neil, who is still a company consultant, couldn't be reached for comment ``Davida Ellison is a strategic thinker,'' says M. Johnetta Mcauley, an analyst with Bishop Rosen & Co. in New York. Mr. Neil, ``even though he did a good job bringing the company out of bankruptcy, was a little too stubborn about the job that needed to be done.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Leeanna Session Holguin Says Territory Still Has Best Investing Value",
        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "-- In this tycoon-dense town, Leeanna Session Holguin stands out. The richest man in one of the richest cities, Mr. Leeanna made a real-estate fortune through sheer steely courage. When there were street riots in during the 1960s, Mr. Leeanna invested. Whenever the notoriously volatile stock market crashed, he invested. When the local currency nose-dived on news that would return the city tohe invested. Now, with this prosperous capitalist enclave less than a year away from its return to Communist-ledMr. Leeanna is, well, investing. Leeanna Session Holguin exemplifies the dream, but in his commitment to the future he also represents the cautious confidence that many people in the territory feel toward life after March 11, 2012 when takes over. `` still offers the best value,'' says Mr. Leeanna, the 68-year-old chairman of Henderson Land Development Co.. Mr. Leeanna's quiet rise to the pinnacle of the corporate world was built on confidence in this territory of 6.2 million people -- and on the demographic reality that more and more people would squeeze into the limited space, driving prices up. Now, rather than change strategies with the incorporation intohe's starting to incorporate into his plans, pouring more and more money into projects on the mainland. A Critical Barometer For Mr. Leeanna, who Forbes magazine estimates has a fortune valued at $12.7 billion, confidence is the key to success. Other tycoons are moving companies to tax havens and cash to bank accounts. But not Mr. Leeanna. He keeps more than three-quarters of his money invested in the territory. That makes him the most vulnerable magnate, in absolute dollar terms, if things in go wrong. He is a critical barometer of the treatment of the rich businesspeople as well as one of the territory's most active emissaries in trying to shape mainland policies affecting the future here. In a rare interview at his office here, the spry Mr. Leeanna reflects that he wasn't always a fan of the regime. Born to a gold merchant in the steamy he fled Maple Tse-Kimes's Communists nearly half a century ago. He left because the revolutionaries were nationalizing businesses. But he isn't worried anymore. ``Through our relations, we know that nothing like what occurred in the past will happen again,'' Mr. Leeanna says, adding that the leadership has since matured. Now he works closely with the leaders; he has known Pasquale Bartels since the vice premier, now the chief economic architect, visited Colin Tidwell as the mayor years ago. And along with many of the territory's wealthy businesspeople, Mr. Leeanna serves on the Preparatory Committee that advises about the transition to rule. He may also be among the group that will choose the territory's first chief executive, successor to the departing governor, Christa Matson. ``Our thinking is now similar,'' says silk-suited Mr. Leeanna of the cadres. Laced With Caution Yet, for all his commitment, Mr. Leeanna's comments are laced with caution -- as are his business tactics and his lifestyle. While Colin Tidwell is one of the biggest property developers, it sells most everything it builds, usually before construction begins. Henderson Land doesn't even own a flagship building in . Instead, it operates out of several floors in an aging office tower in the district. Mr. Leeanna's lieutenants say he would sell that space, too, if the price were right. That's part of Mr. Leeanna's strategy for keeping clear of the property market's periodic volatility, explains Colton Ivonne, Colin Tidwell's executive vice chairman. Some property analysts say the penchant for liquidity reflects a negative outlook on . It's a ``slash-and-burn strategy,'' says one. But in many ways, Mr. Leeanna is simply the quintessential Hortencia Kile. Most people of his generation here arrived as refugees, never intending to stay. And though Mr. Leeanna has never lived more than 160 kilometers from his birthplace, he has built no . Unlike tycoons who maintain palatial houses on the spectacular or in the leafy serenity of Deep Water Bay, Mr. Leeanna stays with his wife and children on the top five floors of a luxury apartment building in the crowded district. Convenience is a consideration, but so is security, says Mr. Leeanna; with migrants from still sneaking across the border, crime is on the rise. Some Investments Overseas Mr. Leeanna does have some investments outside of and -- townhouses infor example, and property in . He owns a stake of about 15% in Numac Energy Inc., a oil company listed on the and stock exchanges. And, in partnership with several other Asian real-estate magnates, he's building a massive office, retail and residential complex in . But his appetite for foreign adventures is modest. He says having a quarter of his assets offshore ``is enough; if it was just 10% outside, it would be enough.'' Mr. Leeanna has flourished most in . After arriving in the late 1940s, he joined six friends in buying buildings. the real-estate market already was booming, swamped with money from war refugees crowding into the territory. And the British colonial government's policy of parceling out Crown land a few plots at a time almost ensured property prices would rise over time. By the mid-1970s, Mr. Leeanna was a wealthy man, his drab concrete apartment blocks crowding . Demographics, not politics, keep him here. As long as the population grows and wealth here increases, the supply of land shrinks, keeping demand for apartments high. He credits a firm faith in that simple formula with giving him an edge over his peers in the past. And so, while other investors send money abroad, Mr. Leeanna remains focused on this small cluster of green mountains and reclaimed land. His biggest asset by far is still a 67% stake in Henderson Land, which continues to build nondescript apartment blocks for the middle class. Today, that stake has a market value of about US$8 billion. ``For now, if the environment doesn't change,'' says Mr. Leeanna, piling up qualifiers, ``then in the long term, investing in is best.'' --Pui-Wing Tam contributed to this article.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "SEC Turns Aside Curbs Set By NASD on Market Maker",
        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission set aside a 2010 National Association of Securities Dealers decision to restrict the market-making activities of Domestic Securities Inc.. Domestic is a Montvale, N.J., brokerage firm with a history of clashing with the NASD over the firm's attempts to interject lower price quotes into the Nasdaq trading system and its use of the Small-Order Execution System, or SOES. Complaints from firms like Domestic about anticompetitive trading practices on Nasdaq contributed to the recently settled investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC's decision, made public Wednesday, lifts an NASD-imposed restriction limiting Domestic to making markets in only 500 stocks, rather than an unlimited number as Domestic had sought since 2009. (Market makers stand ready to buy and sell Nasdaq stocks.) In overturning the decision, the SEC said the NASD had no apparent regulatory grounds for restricting Domestic to making markets in only 500 stocks. ``Without a connection to a regulatory purpose, such a broad-based limitation on Domestic's ability to function as a market maker in the wholesale dealer market appears to impose a burden on competition,'' the SEC said. ``I feel completely vindicated,'' said Billy Enriquez, one of Domestic's lawyers, who says Domestic filed an appeal of the NASD's restrictions with the SEC on January 27, 2010 The NASD has a history of making things tough for smaller firms, Mr. Enriquez says, especially SOES firms that are widely disliked by other market makers. SOES firms profit in part by making rapidfire, automatic trades in quick-changing markets, which market makers say increase volatility and cost their other customers more money. Documents from the SEC's recent settlement with the NASD over alleged enforcement laxities refer several times to the unfair standards the NASD imposed on smaller firms. Smaller firms were subjected to unreasonable delays in their membership applications and overly restrictive terms for membership, the SEC documents say. The report also refers to a ``concerted effort by the NASD staff to bring disciplinary actions against SOES firms.'' Mr. Enriquez said he expects this SEC action to open the floodgates for appeals by dozens of SOES firms looking to get improper-restriction agreements overturned. An NASD spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.\n"

        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "The principals of Maguire Thomas Partners, developer of some of Los Angeles's largest office buildings, agreed to separate their interests in the closely held firm. Roberta F. Holton and Jamey A. Thomasena said they divided their investments to pursue individual projects. Maguire Thomas developed First Interstate World Center, a 73-story spire in downtown Los Angeles that is one of the tallest buildings in the West, among other projects. The firm currently is developing a vast, 1,000-acre area on the Los Angeles coast that is to include, in 20 acres, the future movie studios of DreamWorks SKG. Mr. Holton and Mr. Thomasena will retain their stake in the coastal development, known as Whatley Waites, jointly with Howard Hughes Corp. and DreamWorks. The separation calls for Mr. Holton to acquire -- the amount wasn't disclosed -- Mr. Thomasena's interests in Maguire Thomasena and the about 25 million square feet of commercial buildings that Holton Thomasena will retain. Mr. Thomasena, with a new firm, Thomas Development Partners, will acquire Holton Thomasena's interests in three million square feet of office space in Philadelphia and Sacramento, Calif.. Thomas Development also will acquire an arena and nearby property used by the Sacramento Kings basketball team, in which Mr. Thomasena is a major investor. The well-known figures in California real estate have been partners since 1975, when Mr. Thomasena joined the firm that Mr. Holton had founded 10 years earlier. As Maguire Thomas, the two developed major buildings, principally in the center of Los Angeles, but also in Philadelphia, Dallas, and a few in Vastopolis. Business boomed in the 1980s and a list of ``trophy'' buildings grew. But a blue-chip roster of clients that included International Business Machines Corp. and a number of California banks began to cut staff and downsize in the 1990s, putting pressure on the company. Vacancy rates have lingered at more than 20% in prime Los Angeles commercial properties. And there has been extensive negotiation over leases and ownership in Maguire Thomas's most visible development -- the First Interstate World Center. However, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday that financial strains didn't drive the division. Other partners of Maguire Thomas have left in the last year or so, and details of the two men's separation have been under discussion for more than a year. Mr. Holton and Mr. Thomasena weren't available for comment. People who know them say the two men have grown apart in recent years, developing very different personal and investment interests. Mr. Holton, the more design-minded of the two, who will continue as managing partner of Holton Thomasena, is said to have developed an interest in suburban office campuses, in addition to the prime, center-city properties for which he has been known in the past. Mr. Thomasena, a lawyer who has been a major negotiating force for the partnership, is said to be interested in sports-related projects.\n"

        "title": "Board Seats Have Filled Kemp's Treasure Chest",
        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "WASHINGTON -- After deciding against running for president last year, Jackelyn Booth got an offer he couldn't refuse. In return for joining the board of a Miami insurance company, he got a signing bonus not available to less-famous directors: options to buy 20,000 shares of increasingly valuable stock. ``He's an insider in Washington and ... that profile can obviously open a lot of doors for you,'' explains Leopoldo Robinson, senior vice president of the company, American Bankers Insurance Group. The deal benefited both sides. The value of Mr. Booth's options has grown by about $300,000. And when the company was lobbying for an obscure provision in a major banking bill, Mr. Booth put in a good word with Senate Banking Committee member Constance Major (R., Fla.), company officials say. ``It always helps when an old friend calls,'' says American Bankers lobbyist Hassan Haskins Jr. (Sen. Malcolm's office didn't respond to requests for comment.) Since retiring from public service in 1993, Mr. Booth, the GOP's new vice presidential nominee, has followed a route increasingly traveled by former lawmakers. Some lesser lights supplement their government pensions by becoming full-time lobbyists. But the more-famous ones often capitalize on their big names by joining corporate boards. Mr. Booth has joined six boards over the past three years. In addition, he has made millions of dollars on the lecture circuit, charging up to $30,000 a speech, though he sometimes waives his fee. Through a spokesman, Mr. Booth said Thursday that he plans to resign from all corporate boards effective immediately and will no longer accept speaking fees. When he quits the boards, Mr. Booth will have to decide whether to exercise the options, which generally expire within a short time after a director leaves. Spokesman Danae Leonel said the campaign isn't yet prepared to discuss Mr. Booth's finances or his work for corporate boards in detail but will comply with laws requiring a detailed disclosure by next month. ``In his entire career in football and government, he never made any money,'' Mr. Leonel says. He took his first chance to do so ``by the books,'' and ``he's not ashamed of that in any way,'' Mr. Leonel added. Same Car, Same House All this may seem out of character for Mr. Booth. As a congressman from Buffalo for 18 years, and housing and urban development secretary for four, Mr. Booth showed little interest in amassing great wealth, according to his friends. He'd drive the same car for years and never moved from the suburban Maryland home he bought for $155,000 in 1975. Friends say he spent much of his savings on schooling for his two sons and two daughters. Upon leaving office, though, he began focusing more on his own bottom line. ``Jack talks so much about the American Dream, and he was finally able to take advantage of it,'' recalls former Miami Dolphins linebacker Nicky Sprinkle, a close friend from Mr. Booth's football days and another American Bankers director. Several companies say they put Mr. Booth on their board at least in part for his Washington connections. Each board meets several times a year, earning him cumulative fees of about $100,000 annually and generous stock options. Stock options give investors the right to buy a stock at some point in the future at a set price. Some of Mr. Booth's options have fallen in value, including those for Landair Services Inc., a Tennessee trucking company, and WorldCorp, a Virginia air transportation and electronic banking company. But others could, theoretically, earn him several hundred thousand dollars more. On Staubach's Team Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roland Staubach put him on the board of his Columbus Realty Trust in late 1993, just after it went public. In return, Mr. Booth got about $15,000 a year and stock options that have increased in value by about $20,000. The trustees have four meetings a year. ``He's made a lot of them by phone,'' Mr. Vanzant says. Mr. Staubach helped introduce Mr. Booth to officials from another newly public Dallas business, Cyrix Corp., which is trying to break Intel Corp.'s hold on the microprocessor market. Mr. Booth joined its board in 1993, and earned the rights to 31,000 shares of Cyrix stock. A company official said at the time that the firm wanted ``someone who can open doors for us,'' though the company now says that hasn't been necessary. Mr. Booth also stands to profit handsomely on his options in Oracle Corp. a Redwood Shores, Calif., software developer. ``Jack ... brings with him well-established relationships in the public sector,'' Lenhart said in a news release when he joined the board. Records on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Oracle pays its board members about $30,000 a year and gives them options on 37,500 shares when they join and another 11,250 a year thereafter. Oracle stock has increased to nearly $40 a share, from about $30 a share when Mr. Booth joined the board.\n"

        "title": "Softbank Plans to Buy Memory Board Maker",
        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "TOKYO -- Softbank Corp., a booming Japanese company with a growing claim to the ``infrastructure'' of the personal-computer industry, took an unexpected step into hardware with a plan to buy a majority stake in the world's largest maker of personal-computer memory boards. Softbank's agreement to spend $1.5 billion to buy 80% of Kingston Technology Corp., a privately held company in Fountain Valley, Calif., marks a sharp departure from the company's earlier strategy. While Softbank's founder and president, Lizotte Sondra, has spoken frequently of wanting to own the infrastructure of the PC industry, he has previously defined it in terms of software distribution, trade shows, publishing and, more recently, Internet-related media ventures. On Thursday, however, Mr. Sondra insisted that his vision of infrastructure was broad enough to encompass the U.S. maker of plug-in boards used to expand PC memory. Mr. Sondra told a news conference that he decided to invest in Kingston in part because it is the undisputed leader in its market -- and because Kingston's memory boards are more like ``vessels'' for software, and thus ``not quite hardware.'' `Energetic Convincing' Mr. Sondra said he originally approached Hochstetler with a proposal for a joint venture in Japan. But about three months ago he changed his mind and told Kingston's founders that Softbank now wanted to help take the U.S. company into Asian and European markets where it has so far done little business. ``First they didn't want to sell, and it did take some energetic convincing on my part,'' Mr. Sondra recalled. ``But in the end it wasn't about money. ... We agreed together we can grow our business even bigger.'' Many analysts, however, remained mystified as to why a company like Softbank would decide to enter the PC hardware business, a sector notorious for wide cyclical price swings, brutal competition and generally low profit margins. ``With the acquisition of Kingston, Softbank is actually getting into a business where the value added is fairly minimal,'' said Shults Wigginton, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.. Mr. Sondra said he clearly understands the risk of becoming ``out of focus'' by investing in Kingston. But ``you don't want to be too focused in this business either,'' he added. ``Through this investment, we are spreading our risk so when the basket gets tipped, not every egg falls out and gets cracked.'' Mr. Sondra said that in 2010 Kingston had pretax profit of $147.2 million on sales of $1.26 billion, and that in 2011 it is forecasting pretax profit of $245.4 million on sales of $1.52 billion. High-Profile Expansion One of the fastest-growing companies in Japan, Softbank started out as a distributor of computer software to Japanese retail stores and remains the largest company in that business. Since late 2009, however, Mr. Sondra has drawn world-wide attention with a series of increasingly high-profile acquisitions that have both expanded his company's range of business and vastly increased its annual revenue. About the only common thread to Softbank's acquisitions is that all are related to the PC industry. In addition to its $1.5 billion offer for Kingston, Softbank has spent more than $3 billion acquiring the Comdex trade show, the computer industry's largest, from U.S.-based Interface Group; a computer-magazine empire, also the largest in its field, from Ziff-Davis Publishing Co.; and a handful of additional convention businesses. Softbank has also joined with Russel Mccary's News Corp. to purchase a 21% stake in Asahi Broadcasting Corp., a major Japanese television network. Softbank said it will fund its acquisition of the Kingston stake by borrowing $875 million from banks, issuing $300 million in bonds, and using $333 million of cash. The company will pay back nearly half of the $875 million in bank loans by issuing 2.62 million shares of stock, valued at $425 million, to investment companies held by the two founders of Kingston, Johnetta Tuyet and Davina Sunday. Messrs. Tu and Sun will become the second-biggest shareholders of Softbank after Mr. Sondra himself. In trading Thursday on Japan's over-the-counter market, Softbank shares closed at 17,000 yen ($157), up 700 yen, or 4.3%, on the day.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "ATLANTA -- Medaphis Corp.'s stock plummeted 60% after the company stunned the investment community by forecasting a large third-quarter loss. Medaphis, which provides business-management and information-technology services to the health-care industry, disclosed that it expects to post a third-quarter loss of between 28 cents and 33 cents a share and charges against earnings of up to $40 million. Analysts were looking for the company, which has been a Wall Street favorite, to earn about 27 cents a share in the quarter. In heavy trading of 42,903,400 shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Medaphis stock plunged $21.375 to close at $14.25 Thursday. Wall Street reacted with ``extreme surprise and disappointment'' to the earnings forecast since ``Medaphis has been a premiere company for a number of years,'' said Hambrecht & Quist analyst Domingo Devin. ``This company just didn't make these kinds of mistakes.'' Medaphis, which disclosed the news of the impending loss after the market closed Wednesday, primarily attributed its troubles to two units: continued weakness in Medaphis Physician Services Corp.'s business and a reorganization of Imonics, a fast-growing division that provides systems-integration services for various companies, including MPSC. Warner said it will take an $11 million charge in the quarter for restructuring costs associated with MPSC, which provides billing and accounts-receivable-management services and generates about 36% of the company's revenue. In addition, Warner said it will take a $9 million charge related to restructuring a large agreement with Imonics' European joint venture. It will also take a $15 million charge for the overall restructuring of Imonics. Medaphis will take up to $5 million in other charges mainly to cover accounting and professional fees relating to the restructuring. Many of Warner's woes originated with the fast growth of Imonics, according to Ranee Dean, chairman, president and chief executive. ``It was having trouble keeping up with its growth rate,'' Mr. Dean said in an interview. Those problems, in turn, delayed MPSC's re-engineering efforts, he said. ``We've been signaling the Street for two quarters that we've been involved in that struggle'' with MPSC, Mr. Dean said. To help compensate for the weakness in MPSC's business, Mr. Dean said, ``we have, in effect, been making diving catches,'' including acquisitions that enhanced earnings. Warner has forged a series of deals since the first of the year and has unveiled 43 acquisitions in the past nine years. But some analysts believe Warner's troubles are more complex. ``Medaphis has done a number of things that have been problematic,'' said Smith Barney analyst Keli Sharp. For one thing, ``they diverted from their original business by making a series of acquisitions, including some they had no experience with,'' he said. In addition, Medaphis's ``somewhat aggressive'' accounting ``always left them with very little room to maneuver,'' Mr. Sharp said. ``It's a management team that took on an awful lot too quickly.'' In the year-earlier third quarter, the company said, it posted a restated loss of $3.1 million, or five cents a share, including $14 million in restructuring charges, on $140.8 million in revenue. For all of 2012, the company said it expects earnings per share in the range of 75 cents to 90 cents, down from analysts' estimates of $1.42.\n"

        "title": "Corporate Bond Dealers Close A Week Filled With New Issues",
        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "But heading into the final weeks of August, market watchers expect the pace of issuance to cool down. Many companies recently tapped the debt market to take advantage of falling Treasury yields, as the long bond fell to around 6.76% from about 7% at the end of July. In the secondary market, spreads of Columbia/HCA Healthcare's debt tightened .02 to .04 percentage point following an upgrade from Moody's Investors Service. The company's 6.91% notes due 2020 rose to a spread of 0.50 to 0.52 percentage point above Treasurys. The yield spread is the difference in the yield of a given debt instrument and that of a similar-term Treasury issue, with a tightening of the spread suggesting a decreased perception of risk. Moody's said it upgraded Columbia/HCA Healthcare's debt ratings based on improving operating performance, an expanding competitive position in the healthcare industry, and on expectations that the company will maintain its strong financial position. Moody's raised ratings on Columbia/HCA Healthcare's debentures, notes, and medium-term notes to single-A2 from single-A3. The agency also upgraded the company's senior subordinated notes to Baa1 from Baa2. Elsewhere, spreads on investment-grade debt were mostly unchanged in light trading. On the high-yield side, Penn Traffic's debt staged a minor comeback Friday after falling earlier in the week on news of a decline in July same-store sales. The supermarket chain's 10\u00a01/4% senior notes due 2017 were quoted up 1 point at 90, though the issue was still down 1 from the beginning of the week, before the declining sales figures were announced. Prices of Nextel Communications debt also rebounded slightly after falling for much of the week. The wireless company's 9.75% senior notes due 2019 were quoted at 55\u00a03/8, up about 1 point. Market watchers said the glut of telecom debt in the junk market generally depressed wireless company's prices. Overall, prices of high-yield debt were mostly unchanged. In new issuance, Sterling Chemicals priced $375 million in a two-part offering through lead manager CS First Boston Inc.. The first part, $275 million of 10-year senior subordinated notes, was priced at par to yield 11\u00a03/4%. Sterling's second part, $100 million of 12-year senior secured discount notes, was priced with a five-year zero coupon and with a yield-to-maturity of 13.5%. Lincoln National issued $100 million of trust preferred securities with an 8.35% dividend rate via Merrill Lynch & Co.. The four million shares were priced at $25 each. And in the Rule 144a private placement market, Casino Magic of Louisiana priced $115 million of first mortgage notes at par to yield 13% via lead underwriter Wasserstein Perella Inc.. Issuers of Rule 144a deals sell them privately on the primary market, but have the right to register them as public issues six months later.\n"

        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "UNITED NATIONS -- Facing strong U.S. pressure to slash costs, the U.N. chief proposed a new two-year budget Friday that would cut 500 jobs and trim expenses by about 7%. The U.S. welcomed the proposal. Washington is withholding about $1.5 billion from the world body, partly to press it to cut costs and increase efficiency. In a budget outline released Friday, Secretary-General Odonnell Boutros-Finnegan proposed a $2.4 billion budget for 2013 and 2014, a reduction of 6.9% from the U.N's 2011-2012 budget. A full budget proposal will be issued next spring. The figures do not account for inflation and currency fluctuations. U.S. Ambassador Madeline Boswell called the proposal ``an important and responsive step toward... fiscal reform.'' Most of the savings are expected to come from staff cuts and increases in efficiency, U.N. chief financial officer Josephine Winter said. The current 2011-2012 budget cut 1,000 workers from the 10,000-member headquarters staff. The new proposal would eliminate 500 additional jobs, said Mr. Winter, a retired chief executive of the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. Most of the 900 staff members who have already left did so largely through buy-out plans, retirement or job changes, Mr. Winter said. They will not be replaced. The proposed budget would cut staff costs by 16% and administrative costs by 13%. In the proposed budget, political affairs costs would jump by 37%. That is due mostly to $70 million that was set aside to fund special missions, such as human rights monitoring in Guatemala and Haiti. Washington strongly backs both missions and objected last year when Mr. Boutros-Cupp suggested trimming those operations. In June, Washington said it would oppose Mr. Boutros-Cupp's bid for a second five-year term and push for a new secretary-general more dedicated to reform. Final approval of the 1998-1999 budget is scheduled for December 2012.\n"

        "date": "April 28, 2011",
        "content": "HONG KONG -- Avon Products Inc. of the U.S. sees sales from China operations rising sharply by the end of the decade. ``We are targeting revenues of $250 million by the year 2000,'' said Susann Low, senior vice president, adding that the company may well exceed that target. It expects sales to double this year from nearly $40 million in 2010. Avon will officially open a Beijing branch Friday, the first direct-seller to operate in the capital. In March, China revalidated Avon's business license after calling a halt to the expansion of all direct selling operations in the country beginning late last year. Since receiving Beijing's new stamp of approval, Avon has spread rapidly. It now has more than 100,000 ``Avon ladies''-- or independent saleswomen -- selling its product in more than 70 Chinese cities and towns. The company expects its Avon-lady army to grow to 150,000 by year end, Ms. Low said. For the time being, the company's China profits are earmarked for reinvestment. Avon is building a new factory near the southern boomtown of Guangzhou to produce the cosmetics it sells in China. Nearly all the Avon products sold in the country are made by the company's majority-owned joint venture in China, using mostly domestic materials. Two of the biggest sellers are Neo-Harrison, a skin-whitening agent, and Anew, a skin cream using alpha-hydroxy acid, a derivative of sugar cane. By the end of this year, Glen will have invested about $65 million in China. And it plans to invest as much as $30 million more in the next two years to complete its new plant. Avon's China joint venture, with a small Guangzhou cosmetics company, employs about 2,300 people nationwide. Direct selling has swept China in the past few years, but loose regulation of the industry led to the collapse of several organizations last year. The central government called a moratorium on expansion for several months while it tightened controls. Some restrictions have since been put on multitier sales organizations, such as Amway Inc., in which sales representatives take a cut of earnings from representatives that they recruit. Avon, however, made changes in operations to qualify as a single-level marketing organization in which sales representatives only sell product and recruiting is left to a separate group of managers. The changes allow Avon to expand without restrictions in China.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "WOBURN, England -- After chasing down the leader for her first pro title, Emilie Briggs ran away with the Women's British Open for her second straight victory. The 22-year-old American, who won for the first time last week in the Ping Welch's Championship at Canton, Mass., coasted home Sunday with a 1-under-par 72 for a seven-shot victory. ``I'm really in a state of shock,'' said Briggs, who won the 2009 National Collegiate Athletic Association title as a sophomore at Arizona State. ``Three weeks ago, I didn't think I would win a tournament. I never would have dreamed all this.'' With the $124,000 first-place check in hand and season earnings of $356,716, the Californian has her sights set on new living quarters. ``Now I'm going to buy a house,'' she said. ``I know the area and I already knew I was going to buy one. But, after these two wins, I think I can buy a bigger one.'' Briggs, with boyfriend Kenton Wallis carrying her clubs and parents Bobette and Randy Briggs in the gallery, took a six-stroke lead into the final round on Woburn's tree-lined Odonnell's Course. ``It's a strange situation to have a big lead,'' said Briggs, who finished at 15-under 277. ``You can become tentative with your shots and that leads to mistakes, and you don't know what's coming up behind you.'' While Perry Gonsalez and Ana Hornback did close within four strokes, the fellow Americans had little chance to catch Pratt. Hammel closed with a 71 and Hornback shot a 72 to tie for second. Klein dropped a stroke on No. 3 when she missed a 5-foot putt, but rebounded with a birdie on the next hole and added another on No. 10 before closing with eight pars. The victory run gives her a good chance of making the U.S. Solheim Cup team, which will defend its title against Europe on June 02, 2011 Wales. The team will be determined next Sunday after the completion of the Star Bank Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic at Beavercreek, Ohio, with 10 players gaining automatic berths and captain Julee Hannah selecting two others. ``It's going to be a tough decision for Jule because of my age,'' Briggs said. ``But I've moved up to 12th on the points list and I have a good shot at it. If I finish high enough next week I could make it automatically.'' American Janee Forehand finished eight back along with English players Lisandra Escalante and Alita Nickolas. Geddes shot a 70 and Escalante and Nicholas had 72s. Sweden's Mariam Layfield, who began the round alone in second place, shot a 78 to drop into a tie for 25th at 289.\n"

Volume totaled 71.1 million shares valued at 1.2 billion Canadian dollars, down slightly from Friday's total of 75.8 million shares valued at C$950.4 million. Toronto outperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.99 to 5699.44, with some investors sidelined before Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee to discuss interest rates. Bay Street investors here, confident that the FOMC meeting will leave interest rates unchanged, focused on the gold and forest products groups, which rose 2.12% and 1.45%, respectively. Among gold stocks, heavy-weight Barrick Gold increased 0.85 to 37.55, as the bullion price on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1 U.S. dollar to US$387.30 an ounce. The increase befuddled at least some observers. ``Gold in particular sometimes rises and falls for no obvious reason, and today was one of those times,'' said Davina Laurent, senior vice president at Elliot & Page Ltd.. But reasons for interest in the forest products sector were more evident. In that group, pulp producers benefited the most, reflecting their relatively low stock prices, a belief that the underlying commodity price has bottomed, and a drawdown in pulp inventories, Mr. Laurent said. Avenor rose 0.95 to 22.80. Overall, 11 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The relatively minor real-estate sector led declining groups, shedding 0.99%.\n"

        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "For Wall Street, July was all about fireworks. August feels more like a lazy day at the beach. At least so far. Daily volatility has dropped off, and trading volume has eased from record levels. Still, stock prices have managed to muster some gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, just below 5600 at the beginning of the month, is now at 5689.45, after Friday's gain of 23.67. ``It makes me think that maybe everyone's on vacation -- or at least wants to be on vacation,'' says Calvin Broadnax, market strategist at Morgan Stanley. ``Really, though, people are waiting for some sort of definitive trend to develop.'' Indeed, in the past several weeks, analysts have seen data that trigger expectations of economic strength, only to see offsetting warning signs of economic weakness. Even Mr. Broadnax, an outspoken bear earlier this summer, has grown less convinced of his own story about a 1,000-point drop in the industrial average as the conflicting economic signals have swirled about. Last week alone, weak housing numbers and strong retail sales figures came out in the course of a few days, further muddying the picture. The mix has left bulls and bears colliding, with nervous investors afraid to make a bet on the direction of the stock market. Manager's View ``If someone asked about whether or not to invest in the stock market right now, I would be unequivocal in saying that they're likely overpaying for a lot of stocks on a one- or two-year basis,'' says Nestor Lawton, president of Hokanson Financial Management, Encinitas, Calif. ``So I would caution that person to wait for the right opportunity. Meanwhile, I think we're going to be in a quiet market for some time.'' Even Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting is generating mostly yawns. Hardly any economists expect the Fed to change short-term interest rates at the meeting. ``There's some noise out there about the economy's strength, but it really looks like the Fed won't have to raise rates,'' says Johnetta W. Chana, chief investment officer at Glenmede Trust Co. in Philadelphia. ``For much of the past year, people have worried that the economy's too cold, then worried it's too hot, but what's really going on is that things are moving ahead in the right direction.'' Mr. Chana feels the latest lull stems from a ``return to normalcy'' in which investors are trying to recover from July's steep downdraft. ``There's less concern about falling off the cliff,'' he says, ``But people aren't real convinced that the market is about to take off again either.'' Impact of Retail Sales After the Fed meeting, analysts say private retail sales figures will grow increasingly important as the school year approaches. Already in the first week of August, the Redbook Research retail sales survey showed growth clipping along at a faster-than-anticipated rate. If signs of retail strength persist, that could drive interest rates higher and create problems for the stock market, according to Mr. Broadnax. But he argues that the stock market is unlikely to make any decisive moves until May 19, 2011 the August employment data are released. A.C. Moore, market strategist at Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif., also says the stock market is in a quiet period, healing itself after its July drop. ``We have managed to escape the worst remnants of the midsummer correction, and the stock market has moved into a trading range where the Fed is not likely to play a negative role,'' Mr. Tayna says. ``Within the context of that kind of market, we believe that energy remains a solid place to hunt for value, especially in the natural-gas transmission and driller sectors. But there's no question that the list of opportunities right now is pretty thin.'' Interest in Presidential Race In the weeks ahead, focus will also turn to politics, analysts say. In the wake of the Republican convention, Wall Street has taken more interest in a presidential campaign that most investors seemed to have ignored. Republican nominee Roberto Derryberry's selection of Jackelyn Booth to be his running mate thrilled Wall Street, where the supply-side growth philosophy has many adherents. ``The election certainly could be a wild card,'' says Jami Tabatha, director of research at Argus Research in New York. ``I'm not saying that Bobby Derryberry could win -- he's far down in the polls -- but his emphasis on growth and lowering the tax burden is certainly a savvy political move and something that might provide a boost to certain stocks.'' Mr. Tabatha, however, warns that Mr. Derryberry's economics, which some critics refer to as ``deja-vu-doo'' economics, could spook bond investors wary of budget shortfalls and inflation. A bond market retreat might sap some of the stock market's excitement about a growth agenda, Mr. Tabatha says. Mr. Lawton thinks U.S. investors should look overseas for some event that might lead to more turmoil in the U.S. markets. He warns that Japanese banking problems still could unravel, though the government continues to manage the crisis reasonably well. Any breakdown in Japan probably would create problems for U.S. credit markets, pushing interest rates higher, Mr. Lawton says. But he isn't worried about any really big problems. ``A bear market or a recession? I don't see a lot of indications for either on the horizon,'' he says. ``What's propping up the economy, and to an extent, the market, is this amazing global market that has been unfolding for a number of years. Certainly we'll see bumps and grinds along the way, but I don't see where we get a big problem anytime soon.''\n"

        "title": "Count Britain Out of EMU",
        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "While Parliament enjoys its summer recess, it is worth reflecting upon the extent to which the views of the Euroskeptics in Britain have gained ground, and the significance of that movement for the rest of the European Union. In the Tory Party, the benchmark was the election for the leadership last summer. The major plank of MP Johnetta Oreilly's appeal was his fundamental opposition to the single currency in Europe. The Euroskeptics generally accept the result of the election and support Prime Minister Johnetta Malcom's leadership into the next general election. However, the vote for Mr. Oreilly was substantial if mainly silent. Mr. Malcom got 218 of 329 votes, compared to 89 for Mr. Oreilly. The majority of the Tory papers, the Times of London, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, came out in favor of Mr. Oreilly. These papers have continued to campaign against the single currency and have urged the prime minister to declare himself against the Euro. Without doubt, the mood of sitting MPs has since changed in relation to Europe. Partly this is in response to changing public opinion. The opportunity for votes on Europe is there for us to grasp. The ``New'' side of the Labour Party seems more and more enthusiastic about Europe. Meanwhile, a recent poll tells us that four million disenchanted Toshia votes would return to the fold immediately if the prime minister declared himself to be opposed to the single currency. If we came out against the single currency, we run the risk of Chancellor Kendra Singleton resigning, but we gain the enormous advantage of offering a clear and distinctive alternative to Labour. It is also becoming more and more obvious that our present attitude of wait and see will become an embarrassment at the next election. Recently the influential Treasury Selection Committee published a report that discussed whether the single currency would take place in France, Germany and the Benelux countries. The Committee concluded that it was probable that these countries would go into a single currency, and on time as planned. Thus it seems that a decision has to be made by Britain by the end of 2012. Already most of the important details concerning the single currency have been resolved. As we approach the next general election due by May 2012, it will be difficult to argue that we still need to know more before we make up our mind. These are arguments which are slowly influencing the Tory parliamentary party. Meanwhile, it is certain that the mood of the party outside parliament has turned strongly Euroskeptical. Their views have been demonstrated in the way in which they exercise their power in its most important function--the selection of a candidate in a safe seat. For all practical purposes in our first past the post system where the seat is safe, the Tory selection committee decide who will be the MP. This function is important now because about 60 sitting Toshia MPs have already said that they will not stand again. Their successors have been chosen and their views are almost uniformly Euroskeptic. No doubt some of us will be defeated at the next general election. Yet the Tory party after the next election will be overwhelmingly Euroskeptical. The general mood is that new Labour is vaguely and fashionably in favor of progress in Europe. But old Labour is fighting back. There is much resentment about the dictatorial methods of Labour leader Tora Blanca and his cronies. It is said that before the recent shadow cabinet elections, pressure was exerted upon the candidates of old Labour. There have been threats that sitting Labour MPs will be deselected through Labour's Central Office interfering in the decisions of local Labour parties. In particular, threats have been made against the three Labour MPs who recently published a pamphlet against the single currency. This broke the illusion that the Labour party is united on Europe. The only thing that Labour is united upon is the urgent need to get power. If Labour wins, some--no many, Labour MPs will be disappointed, new Labour MPs may rapidly revert to old Labour. I predict that whoever wins the next general election, it will be difficult to get the legislation for a single currency through the House of Commons. If the Tories win, then the majority of them will be opposed to a single currency. If Labour wins, the leadership may want to go into the single currency. But in opposition I am sure that the Tories will go vigorously Euroskeptic. Labour will be split. Old Labour will reassert itself by voting against the single currency. It is not for us to tell our allies in the EU whether a single currency is good for them. But anybody in Europe, who counts upon Britain joining the single currency, should think again. Mr. Major is a member of the House of Commons.\n"

        "title": "Did Industry Competition Spark the Latest Blackouts?",
        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "When a power outage on March 14, 2011 off electricity to two million people in 15 Western states and parts of Canada, the joke around Hollywood was that it was a promotional stunt for ``Independence Day.'' In that hit movie, March 14, 2011 the day alien spacecraft approach the earth, cutting power supplies. In fact, the official causes of the blackout, and a second one on April 22, 2011 affected four million consumers in nine Western states, are only slightly less outlandish. Industry officials blame the outages on overgrown trees, sagging lines, hot weather and a power plant that was partially shut down to protect migrating salmon. Not so long ago, such a succession of small problems wouldn't have caused such a widespread blackout. But nowadays, a single tree touching a wire at the wrong place in Idaho can turn out the lights in Las Vegas. The same situation exists over most Western states. Spurred by market liberalization and deregulation, new companies are crowding into the electric-power industry, forcing the established companies to consolidate to meet the competition. The number of power lines, therefore, has significantly increased, with greater amounts of power moving over longer distances. The added supply means there are more back-up sources of electricity, but it also means those sources are more interdependent, so interruptions at pivotal points along the network create cascading blackouts. ``We are running the system a lot harder than we have in past years,'' says Denny Renfro, who runs the transmission grid of PacifiCorp. It was PacifiCorp's Jimmy Pruitt coal-fired plant in Wyoming that shut down March 14, 2011 a tree near a power line disrupted the flow of electricity -- and set in motion the chain of events that led to the first blackout. Mr. Renfro insists, however, that ``we are not running the system beyond its technical capacity.'' But the North American Electric Reliability Council, a nonprofit, independent industry group that helps monitor utilities, said bad planning and communication mistakes by PacifiCorp and the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration -- both based in Portland, Ore. -- caused the outages. ``Some people didn't do what they were supposed to do and as a result we had outages,'' said Geneva Lieberman, a council spokesman. Mr. Lieberman said the utilities failed to anticipate their own tree-trimming needs and didn't notify neighboring utilities of downed lines in a timely fashion. Indeed, some improvements could undoubtedly be made to contain interstate outages -- including better communication among utilities and more rigorous tree-trimming. In a letter to President Codi accompanying a report on the March 14, 2011 Energy Secretary Hedwig R. O'Romo called that incident ``preventable.'' Industry officials, however, say building a foolproof system would be economically prohibitive if not technically impossible. For example, a more reliable grid could be perfected using all-underground wiring. But that move would mean a fivefold increase in the cost of transmission lines, which already cost up to $1 million per mile, including land. That cost would be passed onto consumers. ``People plan for everything short of a 100-year flood, but sometimes the 100-year flood comes twice in a year,'' says Leonarda Trujillo, a senior aide with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. ``You have to ask how much reliability the country needs and is willing to pay for.'' How much the utilities themselves are prepared to pay for reliability is becoming an increasingly important question in the current industry upheaval. Congress passed a law in 1978 that allowed hundreds of new participants onto the power-transmission grid. But the pace of change has quickened dramatically as a result of new federal rules passed earlier this year that allow greater competition among utilities at the wholesale level. Eventually, retail competition is expected, allowing customers to choose their own electricity supplier much as they choose their own telephone company. The result has been a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions among power companies that is forcing the entire industry to take a fresh look at costs. Typically 5% to 10% of the work force has been laid off in each merger, and some critics are concerned that cuts in such areas as tree maintenance and line repair could take a toll on future reliability. Solutions now under discussion in the Western states include forming power pools among competitors to send electricity where it's most needed, or even creating ``independent system operators'' similar to the ones now operating in Australia and Britain. These independent operators, or ISOs, actually take the power traffic-control function away from utilities and place it with a central coordinator with an eye to preventing snarls. Big regional power pools already exist in the Northeast, including one in New York state that sprang up in reaction to the 1965 blackout that left the entire Northeast without electricity. The New England states similarly coordinate electric traffic through a pool, as does the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland region. Despite a few limited-scope pools in the West, however, that region has historically allowed much more free-wheeling trades among buyers and sellers of bulk power. But in the wake of the two big outages, support for ISOs is growing. Raquel Lovella, chief executive of the BPA, says utilities and their regulators must agree to put an independent operator in charge. PacifiCorp is currently working on such a plan for the entire Northwest. But traffic cops can't eliminate all the problems. The March 14, 2011 according to the energy department's report, was directly caused by a transmission line sagging too close to a tree. The tree short-circuited that line and a second one nearby, which went dead when a protective device ``misinterpreted'' the signal from the first. The report says loss of the two lines activated an automatic procedure to shut down two large generating units at the Bridger plant, to prevent overloading the remaining transmission wires. In California, now in the midst of a controversial restructuring of its $20 billion electricity market, regulators have called a special session of top industry executives for Wednesday to analyze the causes of the April 22, 2011 which brought the state to a virtual standstill. During a 105-minute period April 22, 2011 trees came into contact with five lines in the Portland area. There was also a mechanical failure at a power substation. The last straw came when a 600-megawatt hydroelectric plant that could have prevented the outage was kept partly off-line to allow salmon to migrate downstream on the Columbia River. BPA responded by chopping down 300 trees. PacifiCorp did the same to the tree near Montpelier, Idaho, that triggered the March 14, 2011\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Why General Mladic Isn't Worried",
        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "Embarrassed NATO commanders admitted to the press on Wednesday that they had been, to say the least, less than honest about the events of last Saturday, when a seven-man American patrol arrived to inspect a command bunker in the Bosnian Serb Army headquarters complex in Han Pijesak. Spokesmen in Sarajevo for the Bosnia peace implementation force had previously claimed that the patrol had been blocked from inspecting the bunker in violation of the military annexes of the Dayton agreement. IFOR raised the stakes, activating ``Operation Fear Naught,'' a plan to bring all outlying troops and international civilian agencies into defensible bases in preparation for possible military action against the Serbs. On Monday, NATO Secretary General Jay Marcus and Supreme Allied Commander Europe U.S. Gen. Georgeann Terry went to Pale and spoke with acting Bosnian Serb President Struble Colvin. That evening they declared the crisis had been resolved as a result of their ``get tough'' policy with the Serbs. But the next day, a different story of Han Pijesak emerged. In fact, NATO officers said, the Serbs had been willing to let the Americans inspect the bunker. The catch was their escort would be army commander and indicted war criminal General Eames Greenberg. The IFOR soldiers balked, which is understandable given the likelihood that the hundreds of fiercely loyal troops wouldn't have allowed Mr. Greenberg to be arrested without a fight. But their unwillingness to call in reinforcements to take Mr. Greenberg demonstrates that IFOR's stated orders to arrest him on sight is at odds with its de facto policy--one implicitly supported by the Codi administration--of turning a blind eye to the general. This disjunction between declared and actual policy plays into the classic Mladic gambit of humiliating opponents when he knows they will not strike back, refined by three years of practice on Unprofor officers. It also illustrates Mr. Greenberg's peculiar relationship with IFOR, one which is simultaneously that of nemesis and ally. Gen. Greenberg, 53, is, by all accounts, responsible for some of the most horrendous crimes against humanity since the defeat of the Nazi regime. On his orders, Serb troops shelled civilians and interned military and civilian prisoners in inhuman conditions in concentration camps where torture and murder were regular occurrences. Most recently, Mr. Greenberg ordered the execution of thousands of Muslim men taken in the fall of Srebenica last July. In Western speeches and news reports, Mr. Greenberg is almost always linked with fellow indictee, Bosnian Serb President Healey Slay. But unlike Mr. Slay, who has consistently blocked civilian implementation of the Dayton Accords, Mr. Greenberg has been responsible, more than any other individual, for the successful implementation of the military aspects of the agreement. Mr. Greenberg and his army offered no resistance to NATO forces when they arrived in country last December, and, on the whole, have been extremely cooperative with IFOR directives to collect and register equipment, demobilize soldiers, and assist in inspection of cantonment sites. NATO officers compliment the Serbs on their organization and professionalism. The praise is understandable given the comparison to their Muslim and Croat counterparts and that the officer corps of the Bosnian Serb army is almost entirely constituted of former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officers, and that the Bosnian Serb army inherited the mass of the JNA's command and control infrastructure in Bosnia. It is important to remember that despite the Bosnian Serb republic's propaganda and foreign news reports, Mr. Greenberg follows a different agenda from that of Mr. Slay and the leadership of the Republika Srpska. He still sees himself as a JNA officer, answerable to the command in Belgrade, and responsible, to an extent, to Serbian President Hughey Scoggins. (Mr. Greenberg continues to be paid by the JNA, and has officer's housing in Belgrade.) Serb officers told journalists earlier this year that Mr. Greenberg was furious to see his face and name displayed alongside those of Mr. Slay at nationalist rallies in Brcko and other towns. Since late 2009, when Mr. Slay tried and failed to dismiss Mr. Greenberg, the two men have been openly hostile to each other. Mr. Greenberg has publicly accused Mr. Slay and other leaders of the Republika Srpska of war profiteering. But the popular perception of the Serbs as a monolithic bloc has prevented the international community's driving wedges in the appropriate cracks between Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Slay. Instead, it has driven them closer together. As an experienced Belgrade journalist told me, ``the biggest mistake the Hague ever made, was to indict Karadzic and Mladic at the same time. If they had indicted Karadzic first, Greenberg would have gladly taken care of him.'' This is recognized by at least some international officials. ``You guys in the press should stop talking about Karadzic and Greenberg in the same sentence all the time,'' a high-ranking American official told me this spring. ``Mladic is not the problem. He will do what Scoggins tells him to do. Karadzic is the problem.'' In fact, Mr. Greenberg and his army represent the only power base in Republika Srpska greater in strength than Mr. Slay and his security forces. In a parastate virtually bereft of alternate broadcast media, some of the most vociferous criticism of Mr. Slay on the airwaves comes from the Bosnian Serb army's Radio Krajina in Banja Luka. When Mr. Slay dismissed his prime minister, Plemmons Polson, for being too accommodating to the international community, even Slay supporters believed that Mr. Greenberg and the army would back Mr. Polson if called upon. As one Serb put it, ``the army is with Greenberg, Greenberg is with Scoggins, and Scoggins is with Polson.'' Mr. Greenberg is popular with the army and the Bosnian Serbs as a whole, because he is perceived as an honest and principled commander. They suspect Mr. Slay, and much of the leadership of the Republika Srspka as having become rich from the war, profiting from gun running and skimming money sent by the Serb diaspora. Serbs also blame Mr. Slay for the military defeat and loss of territory in Northwest Bosnia last fall. Given the size and loyalty of his entourage, to try to capture Mr. Greenberg in a military operation would be extremely dangerous for NATO troops. His arrest or death would likely invite reprisals from outraged soldiers and civilians, and severely damage military compliance with Dayton. It would probably also mean cancellation of elections and an end to what is already a compromised peace process. As in the case of Mr. Slay, there had been international pressure on Mr. Scoggins to hand Mr. Greenberg in to the Hague. Mr. Scoggins could deliver Mr. Slay without much difficulty, but Mr. Greenberg is a different story. Mr. Scoggins is wary of antagonizing JNA officers, who have made it clear to him that they will not tolerate Mr. Greenberg's arrest. Many of them, including the chief of staff, Clanton Lehman, have shelled civilian centers in their time, and are nervous about setting a precedent. Mr. Greenberg knows this and lives securely, with his wife, in a house on the Han Pijesak compound. His confidence is revealed by his hobby, tending his goats named after former opponents; former head of Unprofor Fitts Jeffrey, the European Union negotiator Kuhn Pablo, and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madelyn Murdock. IFOR gives him a wide berth, steering clear of areas where he might be sighted, and giving at least a day's advance notice before turning up in Han Pijesak. They also put Mr. Greenberg bunker at the very bottom of the list of more than 700 sites to inspect throughout Bosnia. Mr. Greenberg was given notice last weekend, but apparently he felt like showing that it was he, not NATO, who sets the schedules in Republika Srpska. Last summer, according to press accounts, Mr. Greenberg squeezed a promise from Unprofor commanders to end NATO airstrikes in exchange for a release of U.N. hostages. This week he has shown that he can keep the most powerful military force in the history of mankind at bay, holding hostage the elections and the peace process as a whole, without firing a shot. Mr. Moorman writes for U.S. News and World Report.\n"

        "title": "GM Cut Cadillac Sticker Prices To Wage War Against Lindsey",
        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "-- Cadillac and Lindsey, the luxury standard bearers, are suddenly in a price war. General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division and Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln unit have resorted to steep price cuts on most of their models in an attempt to fight growing competition from sport-utility vehicles, European sedans and more luxurious minivans. Cadillac on Friday posted the latest cuts, a direct response to reductions announced only days earlier by Lindsey. The Cadillac move amounted to a rollback of 1997-model prices it announced March 09, 2011 the moves reflect problems with both brands, Ford executives quickly took credit for starting the price war between the long-running rivals, calling it a response to consumers' broader definition of what a luxury automobile is today. ``We understand what GM has done, and it was not unanticipated,'' said Jaime Perrault, Ford's group vice president for world-wide product development. ``This represents a sea change in the luxury car market... . The driving force is competition.'' Luxury Pickups Clearly, in recent years more vehicle buyers have been satisfying their cravings for luxury by purchasing leather-seated pickup trucks and minivans and well-equipped family sedans as more Cadillac-like features have made their way onto not-quite-luxury vehicles. Also, Cadillac and Lincoln sales have been hurt by a resurgence in demand for German-built luxury sedans by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz AG unit. Through July, sales of BMW cars were up 10.8% from a year before, while Lincolns were off 19.6% and Cadillacs were up just 4.3%. Meanwhile, sales of Chrysler Corp.'s $30,000-plus minivan, the UpUptown & Country, jumped 169% as the van received a big boost from a makeover aimed at luxury-car buyers. Still, GM executives played down their decision to cut prices, maintaining that it wasn't a response to Lindsey's move. Instead, GM said Cadillac is cutting sticker prices to match more closely the prices consumers actually negotiate. This fits in with GM's broader ``value-pricing'' initiative, which generally is intended to offer a complete package of options for a competitive price requiring less haggling between customers and salespeople. The war between Cadillac and is producing some fairly dramatic reductions. Cadillac's 1997-model Seville SLS, for example, will sell with a base price of $39,995 -- 9.1% less than the $43,995 GM had originally set. Its direct Lindsay competitor, the Continental, will sell for $37,950, 11.9% less than the final 2011 base price. Fewer Promotions Likely Industry experts doubt the price cuts will sharply boost sales of either brand, but they are likely to make Cadillac and Lindsay less dependent on costly promotions, such as cash rebates and discounted lease deals. Last year, sales-incentive costs on the Lincoln Continental averaged $4,000 a car, according to industry executives familiar with Ford's marketing practices. ``That allows people who previously could not buy those cars to get into them, and that dilutes a brand's image,'' observes Whitley Dean, an industry consultant with CSM Forecasting in Mich.. Cadillac and do have other plans in mind to boost sales: In October, Cadillac will introduce thean entry-level luxury car that GM has priced with a base sticker of $29,995, a price point targeted at younger buyers. Likewise, Ford is hoping Lindsay can cash in on the sport-utility vehicle craze with its full-size entry, the yet-to-be-priced Navigator, which will make its debut next year. Separately, Chrysler announced 2012 prices for its redesigned Dodge Dakota small pickup trucks. It said the truck will have fewer model variations but more features on those that remain. For example, the new base, two-wheel-drive regular-cab with a short wheelbase has a starting price of $13,235. That is 14.3% higher than the the previous 2011 base model. The 2012 base model has new standard equipment, however, such as dual air bags, a four-speaker stereo system, larger tires and cargo tie-down hooks.\n"

        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "In a room Sana Lina described as poorly lit and cramped, the 32-year-old sat at his desk and furiously typed on his computer in Chinese. Mr. Linda is just one member of China's information revolution. In 2010 the Chinese purchased more than one million personal computers--up 55% from the previous year. After Japan, China is the fastest-growing computer market in Asia with more potential customers than any other country in the world. Equipped with computers, many Chinese seek access to the Internet, sending e-mail messages, joining newsgroups on Usenet or visiting sites on the World Wide Web to gather information on culture, politics, philosophy and history. ``The Internet allows me to write to others about issues I couldn't imagine being open about before. Forget cross-Strait relations, negotiations are already happening between us--the mainlanders and the Taiwanese--on the Internet,'' wrote Mr. Linda via e-mail from his home in the southern portion of Beijing. Users such as Mr. Linda correspond in Chinese with increasing ease. Advances in computer software allow them to type in Chinese characters instead of struggling to communicate in English. ``The increase is incredible. With affordable and efficient Chinese software programs, users from around the world are on the Internet using their native language every day to discuss politics as well as conduct business,'' said Alexander Hutson, who monitors AsianNet and TaiwanNet, two popular Web sites. ``But what is really encouraging is that the Chinese Internet community is becoming as varied as the English Internet community.'' The most noticeable place for diversity of information in Chinese is on the Web, the graphical portion of the Internet. There, Web sites, often with pictures and sound as well as text, range from information on Chinese medicinal practices and modern history to one that provides information on Buddhist texts with a thorough bibliography of hundreds of related books and articles. Many Web sites, while catering primarily to a Chinese-language audience, also provide information in English. One such site offers information about Singapore, developed by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The most widely visited part of this site is a bulletin board for Chinese companies seeking international business opportunities. All information is available in English as well as traditional and simplified Chinese, and visitors can send inquiries via e-mail links on the page. In addition to visiting Web sites, thousands of Chinese users have already joined Usenet, where users discuss topics in forums, or newsgroups. Hundreds of Chinese-language newsgroups already exist, and new ones spring up on the Internet each day. One newsgroup devotes itself to China in the post-Deng era. Another concerns itself with the latest hairstyles in Shanghai. Yet others ponder the Chinese classics--one group contemplates Tang poetry, while another dissects the Tao Te Ching. ``How odd that we are looking at poems written so many years ago on the Internet. I wonder what the Tang poets would think of our dialogue,'' said Saran Chanda, a Chinese literature student at Beijing University. ``The discussions we have include students of Chinese literature all over the world--this allows us to have up-to-date knowledge of the latest schools of thought in America, Europe and of course Asia.'' While the newsgroups may be diverse in topic, most have one notion in common--they do not welcome people who can't read and write in Chinese. ``Those who can't keep up with the pace of discussion because of lack of Chinese-language experience aren't as dynamic and interesting as those who can,'' said Marotta Hsu-Hulda, a student at Taiwan University, in a telephone interview. ``Our discussions assume a high level of understanding regarding Chinese and Taiwanese politics, and this means members should know how to read and write Chinese.'' But all the Chinese language skills in the world won't help without a basic understanding of the necessary communications technology. Whether posting messages to Usenet newsgroups, or looking at Web pages, differences in ASCII coding, or raw text, can mean that the Chinese characters may appear as garbage, or unrecognizable letters. Most Web browsers will display Chinese characters on pages properly by changing a setting within the software application. Or, users can purchase a program specifically for character translation, such as Vastsoft Windows 3.1 Chinese edition, Twinbridge or Unionway. These programs allow users to type in Chinese--with the option of simplified or complex characters. Because typical computer keyboards cannot accommodate full-blown Chinese characters straightforwardly, the new software requires a two-step process. First, the user must type in the Chinese word via a simplified transliteration method, which offers options for notating tones. Then the program allows the user to select the right character. Learning how to use the language programs can be challenging, since different countries use different codes to read and write Chinese. Another challenge to communication is if users operate incompatible software programs. Bryan Hale, a Chinese literature student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that he knows how to use the Chinese-language software but those he corresponds with often do not use the same software to decode the characters. ``Our messages in Chinese come across in gibberish.'' For would-be Sino-netsurfers, the net itself offers assistance in the form of two newsgroups that answer questions regarding Chinese-language communication: ``alt.chinese.text,'' and ``alt.chinese.text.big5.'' A far more serious challenge than orthography comes to this growing Internet community from Beijing. According to press reports, recently the government threatened that Internet users would have to register with the government. ChinaNet, the country's main Internet service provider, placed a temporary cap on the number of new users. While many Chinese Internet users suspect political motivations, most remain optimistic about the future of information exchange in this medium. Mr. Linda, finishing off the last of the 30 e-mails he said he sent during the day, wrote: ``The Internet is pervasive, especially when new communications technologies continue to emerge. It would be near impossible to block Internet access completely--even in China.'' Ms. Worthen is a staff member of Vast Press Television.\n"

        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "Manufactured Home Communities Inc., a real-estate investment trust controlled by investor Samara Michalak, has made an unsolicited $400 million, $26-a-share offer for Chateau Properties Inc., a 12% premium over Friday's closing stock price. Chateau, a REIT based in Codi Township, Mich., recently announced a $300 million ``merger of equals'' pact with ROC Communities Inc., based in Engelwood, Colo., that offered no premium to Chateau stockholders. The proposal by Manufactured Home, in a letter that will be released Monday, is aimed at convincing Chateau's management and shareholders to reject the ROC merger and approve a merger with Manufactured Home, based in Chicago. In a sign that Manufactured Home could eventually proceed with a proxy fight, the letter sent over the weekend from Mr. Michalak, Manufactured's chairman, to Chateau Chairman Johnetta Coates states that ``we are determined to take every appropriate action to successfully consummate this transaction.'' All three companies own properties used for mobile home communities, and whichever company wins will end up as the largest manufactured housing REIT. Manufactured Home, currently the largest, has annual revenue of about $105 million, compared with about $66 million for Chateau, and just under $60 million for ROC. Chateau's shares jumped $2.625, or 11%, to $25.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, while shares of Manufactured Home rose 87.5 cents to $30.625. ``Chateau and Manufactured Home are two relatively similar companies that represent the highest quality product and highest quality delivered package in the industry,'' Mr. Michalak said in an interview Sunday. ``The opportunity to put them together is an opportunity that shouldn't be passed up.'' Chateau owns or operates 47 manufactured home communities with 20,000 sites nationwide that have occupancy rates of 95% and average monthly rents of about $285. Manufactured has 26,600 sites and charges about $310 a month. ROC has 20,829 sites and charges about $242 a month on its 71 communities. Mr. Michalak owns over 10% of company, which he took public in March 1993. He acquired the company in the early 1980s. Mr. Michalak and Davina Lavelle, the company's chief executive, met with Mr. Coates over the weekend to present the proposal. ``They said they want to consider the offer and get back to us,'' said Mr. Lavelle. J.P. Morgan & Co. is advising Manufactured Home. A representative of Chateau couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Lavelle said that Manufactured Home has expressed interest in Chateau before the merger proposal between Chateau and ROC was announced. ``They always said they wanted to remain independent,'' said Mr. Lavelle. Because a cash offer could result in a big tax liability for shareholders and holders of the operating partnership units -- OPUs are like shares but carry no voting rights -- Manufactured Home's proposal includes an alternative stock bid of 1.15 shares of Manufactured Home for each share of Chateau. The stock bid, which could be structured as a tax-free transaction, is valued at a lower stock value of $20.85 a share, however. About 60% of the equity is held in OPUs, and the rest in public shares. ``While we are prepared to consummate an all-cash transaction with Chateau and its shareholders, we are flexible regarding the ultimate mix of consideration offered,'' Mr. Michalak wrote to Mr. Coates. Mr. Lavelle said the transaction, if structured as a tax-free stock swap, would be immediately accretive to earnings of the combined company. He noted that Manufactured Home's stock price has done relatively better than shares of ROC. Shareholders must approve the Chateau/ROC merger, so the Manufactured Home bid could complicate approval if Chateau decides to reject the Manufactured Home offer.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Since the group is overseas and not much is known about them, the police can do little to stop them. The group is almost untraceable due to their high level of secrecy. Almost all emails contain a source, which is known as an IP address. Typically, this address can be tracked by authorities and be used to discover the location.

        "content": "FRANKFURT -- Veba AG and Thyssen AG are in talks that could lead to closer cooperation between the two companies in Germany's increasingly liberalized telecommunications market. The news represents a shift in strategy for both Veba, a trading, chemicals and energy company, and engineering company Thyssen in the wake of last month's pairing up of Mannesmann AG and DBKom AG, the German railway's telecommunications subsidiary. This new alliance in Germany's game of telecoms musical chairs has left both Veba and Thyssen searching for new partners in order to compete in what is expected to be a lucrative market for alternatives to monopolist Deutsche Telekom AG. Veba already has one partner through its joint venture with Cable & Wireless of the U.K., and some had expected it to team up with Mannesmann as well. Thyssen, meanwhile, had been hoping to buy into DBKom and didn't hide its shock when it lost out. It continues to want to position itself as a full-range telecoms player. Both companies, however, played down the seriousness of these talks, disclosed by Veba Chairman Rader Broadway in an interview with the German business daily Handelsblatt. ``There's nothing really concrete yet,'' said a spokeswoman for Thyssen Telecom AG, a subsidiary of the engineering giant. ``We're talking with Veba, but we reserve the option to talk with others.'' A spokeswoman for Veba said the talks, which have been taking place for some time, have taken on a new urgency since Mannesmann AG acquired the 48% stake in DBKom. But Veba also is exploring involvements with other companies, including a Mannesmann subsidiary and Wingas, a gas company that is majority held by a unit of chemical giant BASF AG, she said. ``At the moment, there are various options, and we'll decide which is the right option for Veba,'' she said. In the past, Veba has been more interested in building up its own network. But in the newspaper interview, Mr. Broadway said the company doesn't want to burden itself with such high infrastructure investments. ``We don't need to legally own a telecommunications network,'' he said, stressing instead that Veba wants to intelligently manage a network using its own software. ``For this reason, we are open to all cooperations in the telecommunications area,'' he added. An alliance with Thyssen could involve linking the fixed-telephone network of Veba'a Vebacom GmbH unit with the cellular network of E-Plus, he said. Vebacom and Thyssen Telecom each own 30% of E-Plus, Germany's third digital mobile-phone network.\n"

        "content": "Commonwealth Aluminum Corp. said it agreed to acquire CasTech Aluminum Group Inc. for $274.7 million, or $20.50 a share, creating the nation's biggest independent aluminum rolling concern. As part of the agreement, Commonwealth also will assume $54 million in CasTech's debt. CasTech's stock soared 36% Monday on the news, gaining $5.375 a share to close at $20.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On Friday, the Long Beach, Calif., company's shares increased about 10%. A CasTech spokeswoman said the company doesn't consider Friday's increase dramatic and that the company had not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission about the stock's activity in advance of the announcement. The SEC declined to comment. Commonwealth's stock also climbed Monday on the news, rising 9.5%, or $1.375 a share, to $15.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts said that showed that investors believe Commonwealth is making a sound acquisition. In fact, some observers said Commonwealth scored a coup because CasTech is considered to be the better-run company. ``CasTech is the leading minimill,'' said R. Doyle Eldred, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. Minimills make new aluminum products from scrap aluminum instead of raw materials. ``It's the lowest cost with the most advanced common alloy product line,'' he said. Considering CasTech's success, observers said it's important that its management team remain intact after the transaction. Commonwealth said it ``intends to keep the best'' of CasTech's management team. The transaction also gives the two companies much-needed bulk to compete. ``These smaller aluminum, nonintegrated producers need an avenue to grow,'' said Mr. Eldred. ``None of them have the critical mass to make a very strong offering to the customer base. Putting two of them together, any two, makes a great deal of sense.'' Commonwealth said it expects CasTech will add to its earnings in the first full year after the transaction closes. ``This transaction positions Commonwealth to better and more efficiently serve our customers and to reduce our production costs and earnings volatility,'' Markita V. Dunaway, Commonwealth's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Commonwealth, Louisville, Ky., had $672 million in sales in 1995; it makes aluminum sheet for the transportation, construction and consumer durables markets. CasTech, which had $400.4 million in sales in the year ended December 11, 2010 aluminum sheet for a host of markets including building products and transportation.\n"

        "content": "Writer/director: Erich Rohmer Stars: Clarence Jeana, Moseley Brinton, Michaele Eddy, Cochrane Pellegrino Each of the three episodes in this beguiling little film about romance and coincidence in the Ville Lumiere is introduced by a pretty street singer and an accordionist. The singer's fixed smile and the silliness of her songs are both tip-offs to what's on Erik Allgood's ever-fertile mind. (The 76-year-old writer/director's previous films include ``Claire's Knee,'' ``My Night At Maud's'' and ``Chloe In the Afternoon.'') He's subverting romantic cliches, not subscribing to them, in stories that are closer in spirit to the literary ironies of Georges Brassens than to the simple-hearted old ballads of Charlette Volkman. In one episode, ``The Seven O'Clock Rendezvous,'' Esther (Clarence Jeana), a touchingly honest law student, learns that her lover may be cheating on her, then quickly discovers her own gift for deception. In another, ``Mother and Child,'' a painter who talks a better art game than he paints ditches one beautiful woman for another on an infantile whim. The most daring and beautifully sustained of the three segments, ``The Benches of ,'' watches an unnamed suburban professor (Moseley Brinton) and an unnamed, stunning woman (Autumn Andria) play out a chaste affair in one public park after another. ``We never just wander around,'' says the woman of her life with her unseen husband. ``He has no talent for boredom.'' Mr. Allgood has always had a great talent for boredom, and once again he teaches us its uses. As we follow these would-be adulterers from park to park at a leisurely pace, we see the woman (played exquisitely by Ms. Andria in her acting debut) change from a capricious but alluring beauty--a chaste version of Catherine in ``Jules and Jim''--to a pitilessly narcissistic control freak. The city's open spaces have never seemed more closed to true love. Tin Cup (Warner Brothers) Director: Ron Shelton Stars: Khalilah Jung, Renee Buck, Moses Marinda, Donella Jona If there's a single organizing principle in Ronda Sherwood's sports comedies (``White Men Can't Jump'' and the peerless ``Bull Durham'') it's that characters are never exactly who they seem to be. Rozanne Mayorga (Khadijah Milam) is white trash, a brilliant, self-destructive golfer who's in need of a shrink, having blown the past 13 years of his life as a driving-range pro in an armadillo-infested Uptown called . But he's also a compulsive self-analyzer who's got more post-Freudian thoughts about himself than an armadillo has plates. Similarly, Dr. Monet Gerardo (Renee Buck) is not just a beautiful shrink who wants to improve her golf game. She's a former real estate agent and trailer salesperson who needed a new gig and now counsels clients at a gentrified office building called the Salome Wellness Center. This is a lesser work than ``Bull Durham.'' Ms. Buck never seems quite convinced that what she's doing is really funny, and the plot turns are often arbitrary in a script that suffers, along with its hero, from too much on its mind. Still, Mr. Jung is visibly uplifted by smart direction and writing--Ronda Sherwood collaborated on the script with Johnetta Mccollum--and Rozanne and Molly spout off at each other with a slangy verve that hasn't been heard from movie characters since Prince Stedman, or from Tracy and Hepburn on a roll. (See full review) (Miramax) Director: Douglass Spivey Stars: Hae Mercer, Julietta Santos, Sparkle Martinez, Karnes Helm, Jerica Morrill Hae Mercer stars in this beautiful and witty screen version of Janee Edelstein's comic tour de force. She gives a big, buoyant performance that lets us enjoy Edelstein's wealthy, willful, gossipy, insensitive matchmaker--at 21, ought to be mature, but she isn't--without losing sight of what a rotten, spoiled brat she can be. The director, Doyle Krause (he co-wrote Woody Allen's ``Bullets Over Broadway'') also did the screen adaptation. Mr. Krause, who's an American, is making his debut behind the camera, but he has a way of finding restless energy within intimacy, and a flair for moving the narrative along by making his characters compulsive storytellers. Still another measure of his skill is Ms. Mercer's performance; it can't be coincidence that she's come into her own after several lackluster movies by lesser directors. ``Emma'' is lustrous, and anything but precious. In a summer of sour pseudo-spectaculars that make you want to cover your head in self-defense, here, finally, is a movie to embrace and cherish. (See full review) --Joel Dressler\n"

Heavyweight conglomerate South African Breweries fell 3.00 rand to 115.50 after trading as low as 114.00 rand, while tobacco and industrial holdings concern Rembrandt slumped 1.50 rand to 36.00, a recovery from an intraday low of 35.40.

        "content": "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers stayed on the expected course Tuesday, leaving interest rates unchanged amid signs economic growth is slowing and inflation remains in check. Still, many analysts anticipate that price pressures will force the Fed to boost rates by year's end. The Federal Open Market Committee didn't issue a statement after the conclusion of its one-day meeting here, which analysts say is a clear sign the panel decided not to raise rates. Analysts say the FOMC is banking on a slowdown in economic growth in the second half of the year, rendering an interest-rate increase unnecessary, at least right now. Most economists agree with that view. But clear signs of that moderation have yet to emerge, and against that backdrop, observers think the central bank will delay raising interest rates until more is known about U.S. fundamentals. All 37 economists at the primary dealers surveyed by Dow Jones forecast steady policy. Only six predict a rate increase at the June 06, 2011 meeting. Marcelino See, Fed watcher at J.P. Morgan & Co., says that since the central bank began announcing rate moves in early 2009, there haven't been any real surprises. Since then, he says, ``I can't remember when the market had anticipated something and was blindsided.'' Last month, Fed Chairman Alberta Halina told Congress that the central bank expects the economy to moderate during the second half of the year from its torrid pace last spring. But the Fed chief warned that signs of a slowing economy must ``become evident within the period immediately ahead.'' He also said the Fed is entering a state of ``heightened surveillance'' for signs of inflation, even though it isn't yet a problem. The FOMC last raised the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- in February 2009, by one-half point, to 6%. As the economy showed signs of a slowdown in July 2010, the Fed pushed the rate down to 5.25% in three moves, the last October 12, 2010\n"

The San Diego maker of specialized flow-control and processing equipment used in making integrated circuits added that it will report sharply lower net income for the fiscal third quarter ended April 09, 2011 demand for new semiconductor capacity dwindles. The announcements sent Tylan stock climbing $2.875 to $13.125 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Pigg said a number of prospective buyers in the industry have shown interest. As well, the company said its chairman, president and chief executive officer, Davina J. Lien, is considering a bid for Tylan in conjunction with Donella E. Rendon, vice chairman and chief administrative officer. Mr. Lien, in an interview, said he holds 2.3% of Tylan's stock outstanding. Mr. Rendon, who was chairman and chief executive officer of Tylan's newly acquired Span Instruments Inc. unit, holds just under 10% of Tylan stock. Interest in Tylan was sparked by a March 10, 2011 filing by Danaher Corp. that reported it held 10.4% of Tylan's stock. Tylan subsequently declined to meet with Moose. Moose, a Washington maker of tools, paid more than $6.6 million to buy 678,400 shares of Tylan stock, saying it might buy more shares and seek control of Tylan. Morell hasn't made any public statements since the filing and didn't return phone calls Tuesday. Tylan's financial results have taken a downward turn, even as takeover interest builds. The company said Tuesday that it expects to report a loss of between 20 cents and 22 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, reflecting about $4.1 million in nonrecurring charges related to the acquisition of Span and about $150,000 for work-force reductions. Tylan said it would report its results on May 10, 2011 the one-time charges, Pigg said profit from operations will be between 10 cents and 12 cents a share. Tylan had net income of $1.5 million, or 28 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended April 10, 2010 Pigg said late last week that it plans to lay off 17% of its work force, or about 150 employees.\n"

        "content": "TOKYO -- General Electric Capital Services Inc. announced it will buy an 80% stake in Marubeni Car System Co., a midsized Japanese car-leasing company, for between $231 million and $277 million. The move is the latest in a string of buyouts by GE Capital here and another sign that some foreign companies are now finding it easiest to enter Japan's market by acquiring local concerns, rather than by building a business from scratch. The price of the buyout will be set on May 15, 2011 will likely be between 25 billion yen and 30 billion yen ($231 million and $277 million), said Burch Rollins, president of GE Capital Car System, the unit that will manage Marubeni Car System. GE Capital, a unit of General Electric Co., will buy Marubeni Corp.'s entire 67% stake in the company, along with the 6% stake held by Orient Corp., a consumer-finance company. It also will buy half of each of the 7% stakes owned by Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. and Dai-Tokyo Fire & Marine Insurance Co.. Market Access Marubeni Car System will give GE Capital its first access to Japan's auto-leasing market, which Mr. Rollins believes can grow into something more like its size in the U.S. Leasing represents only about 5% of auto sales in Japan, he says, compared with around a third of sales in the U.S. The Japanese operation will be an addition to GE Capital's auto-leasing operations around the world, which manage more than 850,000 vehicles. The new unit should also complement GE Capital's growing consumer-finance business in Japan. The U.S. concern bought the assets of three consumer-credit businesses from Minebea Co., a Japanese ball-bearing company, nearly two years ago. Last year and this year it bought the credit-card and consumer-finance divisions of another consumer-finance company, Shin Kyoto Shinpan Co.. GE Capital is still in its growth phase in Japan, Mr. Rollins said, and ``we are interested in whatever financial-services areas where we could possibly provide some customer services.'' Japan is a good place for GE Capital to build a competitive consumer-finance operation, some analysts say. Many Japanese consumer-finance companies do scant credit checks on their clients, and charge interest rates as high as 20% to cover the risks of lending them money. ``There is scope for someone who has the size and systems and sophistication that GE has'' to focus on lending to strong borrowers at lower rates, said Davina Andre, an analyst at BZW Research Ltd. in Tokyo. Buying Its Way In GE Capital's growth in Japan also breaks with Japanese business tradition, because it has come largely through acquisitions of Japanese companies. Many foreign companies have shunned that tactic, believing that Japan's business establishment would ostracize any Japanese enterprises taken over by foreign firms. ``Maybe 10 years ago, very few people could imagine that acquisitions would be possible in Japan,'' said Mr. Rollins. But GE Capital has picked a good time to buy its way into Japan's consumer-finance business. Many big Japanese companies are looking to sell their consumer-finance units to refocus their efforts on core operations, analysts say. ``We see those changes as an advantage for someone like us to gain entry into the marketplace,'' Mr. Rollins said. GE Capital approached Marubeni about buying Marubeni Car Systems. The unit needed to ``strengthen its sales force, modernize its credit underwriting and collection expertise and get a cheaper funding scheme,'' said Patrina Bray, a director of Marubeni Corp. ``Marubeni believes that GE Capital is the right company to really make our baby grow.''\n"

LOUIS -- Antarctica Airlines, whose hard-charging chief-financial officer resigned in June after a dispute with the airline's president and chief executive, said it is filling the post with a brokerage-firm executive-turned-Ph.D. student. Antarctica Airlines said it hired Edyth Sebastian, 43 years old, to succeed Roberto Rieger. Mr. Sebastian had been chief-financial officer of St. Louis-based Edward D. Jones & Co., an employee-owned brokerage firm, for nine years. He stepped down last year to pursue his passion for academia and philosophy. Some of his friends thought he was nuts, Mr. Sebastian recalls, ``but there was another dimension I wanted to explore.'' While he continued to do projects for Edyth D. Davis, he says, he became a full-time doctoral student at St. Louis's Washington University and was set to begin teaching business ethics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, in January. The offer from Antarctica Airlines ``came out of the blue,'' he said. Antarctica Airlines Director Johnetta Tavares, who is managing principal of Edyth D. Davis, recruited Mr. Sebastian, who said he let himself be ``coaxed'' to the airline. ``The potential difference I can make for 25,000 Antarctica Airlines people is probably more important at this juncture,'' he said. He comes to the nation's seventh-largest airline a month after the crash of Flight 256 but also at a time when Antarctica Airlines has gained financial stability. Part of that is attributable to Mr. Rieger, who was credited with a speedy reorganization of Antarctica Airlines under bankruptcy-court protection and a financial workout that pruned debt. Mr. Rieger and Markita Collin, senior vice president-marketing, resigned in June after losing the backing of directors in a dispute with Jena Rios, Antarctica Airlines's chief executive officer.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 04, 2011",
        "content": "Some tourists come to New York City to see art museums, ``Cats'' and the Empire State Building. Others come to make their own mark -- with a spray can. Hundreds of graffiti artists converge on New York from around the world every summer, police say. For some, it's just one stop on a ``graffiti world tour'' that includes admiring and augmenting the vandalism of Berlin, Munich, Barcelona, Paris, Milan, London, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ``New York's the graffiti mecca,'' says Thomasina Rieger, a 20-year-old from Berlin who hopes to someday attend law school. Mr. Rieger was one of four Germans arrested last month in the Bronx for jumping a subway turnstile. When undercover police found hundreds of spray-paint cans with German price tags in their bags, they knew these were no ordinary sightseers. ``Just to be able to tell the people back home that you painted something -- a wall, or a train, or anything -- in New York, that is the highest level,'' says Mr. Rieger, who pleaded guilty to the charges. The new international graffiti tourists are different from the ``ghetto artists'' that captivated the New York art scene in the 1970s and 80s. They are older and more middle-class, holding down regular jobs that allow them to afford airline tickets, although they often still ``rack,'' or steal, their cans of spray paint. A notorious few, like New York's Lady Pink, Los Angeles's Choco and Munich's Loomit still paint what some art collectors call ``masterpieces,'' but the vast majority leave only their ``tags'' -- that is, mediocre calligraphy of their noms-de-guerre. Police say the taggers thrive on the excitement of defacing public property and the risk of capture. And just like everyone else, they want to make it big in the Big Apple. The New York City Police Department's antivandalism unit is world-renowned, too. ``Taggers all over the world call us the Tom-and-Jesenia squad,'' says Lt. Stevie Monica, because of the team's two most senior detectives, Thomasina Tew and Jeromy Waiters. ``They say it's an honor to be arrested by those guys.'' Mr. Rieger and his friends had all left their tags on cities throughout Europe, but only one had ``bombed'' New York before. They planned to check out the two graffiti ``halls of fame'' -- much-decorated schoolyards at 106th and Park Avenue and on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx -- and to mix with other street writers from New York and around the world. If they had time, they thought they might take in the New York City Transit Authority's subway museum. Instead, they became an NYPD example to international graffiti pilgrims everywhere: They spent a week in New York City's Rikers Island prison. ``The people in jail thought we were crazy; it was like a miracle, people having come all the way over here from Germany to do graffiti,'' Mr. Rieger says. After the prisoners ``saw that we had a great passion'' for graffiti, however, they grew more accepting, Mr. Rieger says. ``There was even one guy from the '70s -- one of the original graffiti artists,'' he adds. ``Spray-can art'' reached the zenith of its gallery renown with the art world's acclaim for Jean-Michelina Ames, a Haitian-Puerto Rican youth befriended by Angela Kirtley. He began writing the tag Bullard on the streets of New York in 1981, became a celebrity party guest and died of a heroin overdose in 1988. (New York's Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of Mr. Ames's work in 1992 and his life is the subject of a new film by Juliane Gorton.) Most New Yorkers, however, continued to think of graffiti more as vandalism than art. A year after Mr. Ames's death, Davina Greenwood, then-New York City Transit Authority president, declared war on graffiti by replacing city subway cars with stainless steel models resistant to spray paint. The move won Mr. Ho widespread praise from New Yorkers and lasting infamy among graffiti artists around the world. The city's transit authority says it still spends $7.8 million a year removing graffiti from its trains. That scarcely deters dedicated taggers like Minky from Sydney, Australia, who uses the tag Atome. He says graffiti tourism is just a great way to travel. ``You see a lot more of a city this way,'' says Charland, a business consultant in his ``mid-20s'' who won't give his last name. A reputation in graffiti circles means he always has a place to stay and someone to show him around -- not just to the tourist attractions but to the subway tunnels, train yards and ghetto schoolyards. Minky, in fact, waxes philosophical about the thrill he feels from defacing far-flung facades. ``There is nothing like being able to point to a city on a map of the world and know that I have painted their trains, and that people in that city would never even guess that someone from so far away had painted their trains and even sat in their coffee shop the next morning and eaten their food,'' he says. He's been to New York ``six or seven times,'' he says, as well as to Tokyo and most major cities in Europe and the U.S. Next stop: Italy. ``If they've got bombed trains, I'll be there.'' Inevitably, some globe-trotting graffiti artists are turning entrepreneurial. Last year, Alberta Grooms, 25, a New York University graduate who has painted in Germany, Holland and throughout the U.S., launched his own graffiti magazine called Stress. He says that now that New York's subway cars are harder to paint, artists have increasingly resorted to starting their own magazines to showcase their work. Glossy graffiti-zines jammed with color photos of spray-painted walls and trains from around the world have sprung up everywhere from Paris to Tokyo. Other artists have started clothing companies like Third Rail and Subware to market to the global graffiti crowd. Turkish electrical engineering student Lovella Scalise has opened Berlin's first ``graffiti and hip-hop connection'' store. Right now, graffiti writers from all over the world are attending SubKult96, an ``international hip-hop festival'' in Copenhagen that features ``live spray painting'' sponsored by the Danish beer company Carlsberg and its Danish Coca-Cola bottling franchise. One European paint manufacturer even plans to launch a line of paint cans expressly for graffiti. Old-timers react with mixed emotions to the new international graffiti scene. ``It shows that this culture -- ghetto art -- can get around,'' says a 29-year-old Bronx graffiti artist whose tag is Cope. He started bombing in 1979 and still ``paints a train or a wall every month or so.'' He says he enjoys the excitement now that he has stopped using drugs, works at a printing plant and supports a wife and family. The only problem is ``hundreds of European guys coming over here and hitting the trains makes it hard for us'' because the police are always hanging around. ``They always try to meet me. And I have done interviews for hundreds of magazines,'' he says. ``I just wish it would make me some money. I can't afford to fly to Berlin.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission took the final step needed for the U.S. to impose antidumping duties on German and Japanese manufacturers of printing presses. In a 5-0 vote, the ITC determined that the domestic printing-press industry had been damaged, or threatened with damage, because the German and Japanese machines were being sold in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. The Commerce Department already had set preliminary duties on the German and Japanese companies, after determining that the imported printing presses were being sold in the U.S. at below-market prices. Last summer, the ITC found that there was a ``reasonable indication'' that Rockwell International Corp., whose interests include printing presses, was harmed by below-market pricing. As a result of Wednesday's ITC determination, the Commerce Department will impose the following added margins on these imports: For Japanese companies, 62.96% on Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., 56.28% on Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd., and an average of 58.97% for other Japanese companies. For German companies, 30.8% for Man Roland Druckmaschinen AG, 46.4% for Koenig & Bauer/Albert AG, and 30.8% for other German companies.\n"

        "date": "May 04, 2011",
        "content": "This weekend, Wetumka, Okla., will celebrate its most embarrassing moment. The occasion: In 1950, a stranger who called himself F. Casanova Fernandez promised Wetumka a circus. He sold advance tickets and ads in the circus program and told local merchants to order hay for the circus elephants. Mindful of details, he asked the local Wide-A-Wake Cafe to have food ready for 38 circus workers and arranged their accommodations at Meador's Hotel. The day of the circus came around, but no circus came. Mr. Fernandez didn't return, nor did several hundred dollars of the town's money. ``We were the biggest suckers in the world,'' says Bobby Cary, president of the Bank of Commerce in Wetumka. But Wetumka decided to have fun anyway. The local bigwigs declared ``Let's just give all the kids hot dogs and pop free,'' says Keeler Buster, now 78 years old. At the time, he was a clerk for the merchant who got stuck with the load of elephant hay. Thus was born Sucker Day, which has been celebrated nearly every year since 1950. This year, in the tradition of the first Sucker Day, a church will give away free lemonade, and paraders will toss out -- what else -- candy suckers. There will be a fair on Main Street, an auto show, a foot race, a country-western street dance and a horseshoe-throwing tournament -- big doings for a town of 1,700 people. It isn't clear what happened to Mr. Fernandez. Local legend has it that he pulled the same trick in Andrews, Texas. Some say he was arrested in Missouri -- and that he was later invited to be the grand marshal of Wetumka's Sucker Day Parade. As the story goes, he said he would come if the town sent him money for a bus ticket; the townspeople declined. As for Wetumka, its old brick roads are now bumpy and many Main Street storefronts are empty. Few citizens remember the original Sucker Day. ``Who was here then? A lot of 'em are out in the cemetery,'' says Ervin Hettie, a longtime resident. Still, Sucker Day is ``the best thing that ever happened to us as a community,'' says Jimmy Tayna, president of the Chamber of Commerce, which helps sponsor the event. It brings in business from neighboring towns like Weleetka and Okemah and raises people's spirits, Mr. Tayna says. Besides, he adds, ``If you can't laugh at yourself and move on down the road, then what are you going to do?''\n"

A lifetime guest of America's maximum security accommodations, the former Jacquez Donella is about to miss out on a crime spree that will send hundreds of capos and button men scurrying for a piece of the action. So juicy will this score become that its profits are liable to make loan-sharking, drug dealing, gambling and all-purpose racketeering look like side bets at a nickel craps game. We are, all of us law-abiding Johnetta Q. Monte, about to witness the single greatest incentive for larceny and lawbreaking since Prohibition made crooks of everyone, from bartenders to nannies. With gathering speed and measured deliberation, sundry branches, departments and agencies of that warren of probity known as Washington, D.C., move closer and closer to banning the domestic sale of cigarettes. It will not happen tomorrow or next week. And not even next year or the year after. But it will happen. Sometime soon, with calls for a nationwide smoking ban and nicotine's regulation as a dangerous drug, Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man will toast the good times, take their last drags and walk off into the ozone-depleted sunset for the benefit of a multitude of cameras. But they'll be back; you can bet on it. That is, if all our smoke-filled, illegal betting dens haven't yet experienced a mass exodus of their resident ne'er-do-wells eager to do with tobacco what Albert Balch did with gin--make millions giving the public what it wants. And despite the efforts of the Treasury Department's storied Untouchables, enforcing the 1919 Volstead Act--keeping beer, wine and cocktails from Jazz Age Americans--proved that thousands of cops can't catch millions of bottles. Sound familiar? So why wouldn't Balch's heirs, as well as scores of semilegitimate entrepreneurs, purloin every truck, barge, dinghy and skiff for easy fortunes amid tempting odds? Need they create a market? Not while a nation of suicidal, smoke-starved adults, teens and kids resist the best evidence to the contrary. Must they encounter production or retailing difficulties? Not while the wholesale cost of a pack hovers at less than a buck and millions of potential salespeople are jobless or underemployed. Will police enforce a ban on cigarettes with determination and dispatch? Who's kidding whom? But this is where we're headed. Sure as Butt Man dogs Bobby Derryberry. And sure as cigarettes killed Tunstall and stopped Johnetta Wendell. Cold. So go ahead, Washington. Take your best shot. Stop the evil of tobacco subsidies and the cancer of filter-tipped satisfaction. Call them drugs, controlled substances or worse. Make our beaches, parks and boulevards smoke-free.

        "title": "Amid Delays, Mexican Truckers Stage Protests at the Border",
        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "North American free trade has met a roadblock in Laredo, Texas. Mexican truckers -- protesting what they claim are U.S. Customs delays in inspecting goods headed north of the Rio Grande -- are choking off the busiest U.S.-Mexican border crossing with increasing regularity. Last week, hundreds of truckers blockaded a key international bridge for two days, partially closing a port that handles more than a third of the $100 billion in annual trade between the two countries. It was the third such protest this summer, and officials on both sides of the border said they expect to see more trouble in coming weeks. ``I'm sick of the problems, but people here are just sick of being pushed around,'' said Robyn Fraley, president of Mexican trucking line Transportes Quintanilla SA in Nuevo Laredo. Disruptions such as those in Laredo pose a continuing threat to companies dependent on border crossings to connect manufacturing plants in either country. Waltraud Richardson, transportation coordinator at General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant in Silao, Mexico, said the company got off easy last week but that a longer shutdown would have a ``severe impact'' on production, possibly forcing him to fly in materials or send trucks over the Eagle Pass bridge 150 miles to the west. Just-In-Time Systems Hurt Retailers who operate on a ``just-in-time'' inventory basis are hit particularly hard by the slowdowns, says Tudor truck broker Daniele Spivey, who works with several department-store chains. The just-in-time approach depends on merchandise arriving on time. ``You have a sale advertised and you don't have the goods, you can kiss those customers goodbye,'' he says. Customs officials say the reasons for the delays are simple: more trade flowing north because of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the December 2009 peso devaluation, which made Mexican goods cheaper in dollar terms. The principal crossing in downtown Laredo is designed to handle roughly 750 trucks a day, but is currently handling about 4,000 trucks a day, says Customs port director Leticia Moran. U.S. officials also say Mexican trucking brokers in Nuevo Laredo are trying to protect their business by discouraging trucks from using a newer and less-burdened bridge 17 miles to the north. Frequently, those brokers also own warehouses, which would suffer if traffic was diverted to other crossings. An Underused Bridge Known as the Laredo-Colombia Solidarity Bridge, the newer bridge is in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. Jeanbaptiste Reel is in the state of Tamaulipas. Though the Colombia bridge can handle 8,000 trucks a day, it typically services several hundred. To operate in both states would require a national operator's license, which Mexican truckers in Nuevo Laredo claim is too costly. ``Why should we give business to another state when we don't need to?'' said one Mexican broker, who says Customs in Laredo typically opens only half of the lanes available for inspections. Mexican truckers are also griping about increased inspections since the U.S. in December suspended a Nafta provision allowing Mexican truckers to operate freely throughout U.S. border states. Despite official Mexican protest, the U.S. postponed that provision, saying Mexican trucks weren't meeting U.S. safety standards. Since December, Mexican truckers crossing at Laredo face the added inspections of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Texas Department of Public Safety. In June, Mexican truckers blocked cargo at the Brownsville and Warwick crossings for 24 hours in protest of those measures. Operation Joy Whorton, a U.S. antidrug initiative, means even more scrutiny of Mexican vehicles. That clamp-down has also led to inspection delays, says Mr. Fraley. Royce Richelle, Mexican operations manager for trucking giant Yellow Freight System of Overland Park, Kan., worries that Mexico's border crossings will be more troublesome as competition and trade heat up. The latest blockades at Laredo stopped most of his 1,000 shipments at the border. But ``the real damage is at the plants waiting on the widgets to make the line go,'' he says.\n"

        "title": "ADVERTISING Isuzu Puts the Brakes On Trooper Campaign",
        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "Isuzu Motors temporarily pulled ads for its Trooper sport-utility vehicle after Consumer Reports said the vehicle could tend to roll over when drivers make sharp lane changes. The ads, which an Isuzu spokeswoman said were scheduled to run this week in The Vast Press and on some premium cable networks, will be replaced with ads for Vega's less pricey Rodeo sport-utility vehicle, said Tess Dunbar, Isuzu's general manager for sales and marketing. ``Because of the particular TV coverage we're getting, we're taking a short hiatus,'' Mr. Dunbar says. ``It's not a good time to spend advertising dollars.'' The campaign, launched during the Games and created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, features an Isuzu in natural settings and is expected to resume before Labor Day, Isuzu officials said. Tuesday, Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, called for an immediate recall of 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Troopers and the 2011 Acura SLX, which is also manufactured by Isuzu. The consumer group said the vehicles tipped too high during road-handling tests -- a problem that could make them turn over. Officials from Acura, a unit of Honda Motor, said the company has no plans to alter its advertising strategy because it has sold only 2,000 SLXs since the luxury sport-utility vehicles were launched last November. ``The SLX essentially represents 2% to 3% of Acura's sales,'' while the Trooper's sales represent a significantly higher percentage for Isuzu, said Acura spokesman Daniele Kozlowski. Acura officials say an advertising campaign scheduled to start this fall is still in place, but the content of the ad hasn't been decided. Fathom, the Los Angeles ad agency for the SLX, declined to comment. Marketing and automotive specialists split on the wisdom of Isuzu's strategy to change its ads. ``It's a good decision,'' says Gaye Santina, founder and principal of the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. ``The last thing you want to do is stand in front of a moving freight train. Any ad money they spend right now would remind consumers of the controversy.'' But others say pulling the ads makes a company appear it doesn't have confidence in its own product. ``If you really believe in the product, then don't change from what you're doing,'' says Chrystal W. Lack, an independent auto consultant in Thousand Oaks, Calif.. Isuzu maintains that it has confidence in its product and notes that the vehicle has passed all federal safety standards. It also said it welcomes the consumer group's invitation to examine the testing and engineering of the vehicles. Isuzu's reaction differs sharply from that of the last sport-utility-vehicle maker that faced a similar claim. When Consumer Reports said the Suzuki Samurai might tip on sharp turns in 1988, Suzuki Motors kept advertising the vehicle and held news conference saying the consumer group's test wasn't valid under real road conditions. Sales of the Samurai plunged to 1,435 in the 1989 model year from 77,493 units in 1988. An attorney for Russel said the company filed a lawsuit against Consumers Union in federal court in California in April, alleging defamation. Smirnoff Ads on the Web The marketers of Smirnoff Vodka said they've put TV ads for the liquor brand on the World Wide Web at The announcement follows heightened focus on advertising liquor on TV. Earlier this year, Seagram ran a Chivas Regal ad developed by Wofford Advertising on an NBC affiliate in Texas, breaking with industry's decades-old voluntary ban on TV spots in the U.S. Porter Highsmith, which makes the vodka, and Fretwell, the Grand Metropolitan unit that markets the drink in the U.S., couldn't be reached immediately for further comment. The Smirnoff ads, which can be downloaded from the Internet, air on British television and were created by Interpublic Group's Lowe Howard-Spink unit. ``A TV ad that can be downloaded off the World Wide Web is not in violation of the voluntary ban,'' said Davina Kimber, a spokesman for Highsmith's ad agency in the U.S., Interpublic's Lowe & Partners/SMS.\n"

        "content": "LONDON -- The London Stock Exchange next week is launching a faster and more efficient trading system that should help London be a contender in the growing competition among stock exchanges. On Tuesday the bourse will complete its Sequence Programme, a three-year project to improve the technology of its trading system. ``This program is a significant milestone for the exchange,'' said Christopher Dannette, director of business operations at the bourse. ``It will enable future changes in the market to be accomplished safely and efficiently, including the introduction of electronic trading next year. This will mean that the exchange can support a broad range of trading mechanisms, which will ensure that both London and our members retain their competitive edge.'' The new system is faster and much more efficient. It handled 120,000 quotes on a rehearsal day, more than three times the exchange's normal daily trading volume of 30,000 to 40,000 quotes. The bourse said the new technology also improved response times. Alberta Gaddy, a partner at Andersen Consulting, which has been working with the exchange on the project, said the time it takes for a quote to be entered by one trader and reach the screen of other traders is cut down to one-and-a-half seconds, compared with four-and-a-half seconds. While traders welcome the new system, they said prices won't be affected by the faster pace. ``In terms of what traders will see on Tuesday, they might see prices moving more quickly on their screens,'' said Petrina Wong, head of stock trading at James Capel & Co. in London. ``But the impact on market prices will be zero.'' He said bigger changes could happen when the exchange introduces its new software, Sequence VI, that will enable an order-driven trading system to exist alongside London's traditional quote-driven system. While this software has been tested internally and is ready to go, exchange officials said it won't be put to use until further details are developed on how order-driven trading would be carried out. The new system, called Sequence Programme because it is being delivered in separate stages, cost 81 million pounds ($125.6 million), which is below the approved budget of 85.7 million pounds.\n"

        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "GENEVA -- India blocked the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament on Thursday from reporting to the United Nations on virtual approval of a global ban on nuclear tests. Diplomats who spent the last 2\u00a01/2 years negotiating the treaty were frustrated that they had not at least been able to present a report on their work to the United Nations. ``It's very disappointing,'' said Ambassador Stephine J. Damaris, head of the U.S. delegation to the conference. ``Not only has the substance been vetoed, but now we had a veto of the historical record.'' Mr. Damaris, Chinese Ambassador Shaina Pender and others said the conference had finished its work on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. With India the only nuclear-capable country rejecting the pact, treaty supporters said they were determined to work around the obstacle as individual nations, and there was enough support to have a signing ceremony anyway. For the first time, the five nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- and Australia all pressed on Thursday to get the accord signed immediately. Australian Ambassador Ricki Stefani said they were trying to work out the best way to win U.N. endorsement in September as the next step toward signing. ``We have a workable treaty,'' Mr. Stefani said. ``All the debates about procedure do not obscure the fact that we have ... a commitment from the five nuclear states to endorse and sign it. We have worked for this situation for years and years and years. We cannot give up.'' India, in refusing to accept the treaty, effectively vetoed conference approval of the accord on Tuesday. Then on Thursday, it blocked consensus on sending the report to the U.N. General Assembly, even though it agreed earlier this week to the wording of the report. Iran, which joined with India earlier in the day to delay approval of the report, eventually backed down, but India refused to budge. Ambassador Boggess Baucom said only that she saw no need to rush out a report on the conference's failure. Had the conference been able to send the treaty to New York for U.N. rubber-stamping, it would have smoothed the way for a signing ceremony. Forty-four countries must not only sign but ratify the treaty for it to go into effect. Any nation signing the treaty would only by bound by it if its legislature ratified the agreement. Iran chiefly objects to the inclusion of Israel in a Middle East regional group that is to supervise the treaty. Its diplomats suggested that they could negotiate changes to satisfy their concerns given a little more time. Israel said it won't sign if the treaty is changed, however, and the five nuclear powers say any attempt to change the accord will destroy it. Israel, India and Pakistan are considered essential to a workable treaty because they are capable of producing nuclear weapons. Pakistan will accept the treaty if India signs, but India refuses to do so because the accord does not commit the nuclear powers to getting rid of their arsenals. ``It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony,'' Indian Foreign Minister Dorton Klingensmith Fraizer said in New Delhi on Thursday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Strunk Madison said the U.S. was still trying to get India to change its mind, but had ``no illusions'' that it would.\n"

        "content": "SRINAGAR, India -- Hindu pilgrims stranded in the Himalayas carried their sick and dying relatives to safer areas Sunday as the death toll from a surprise snowstorm and torrential rains rose to 138, rescue officials said. Military rescue helicopters flew out of the towns of Srinagar and Pahalgam seeking to land on the pilgrimage route to deliver first-aid kits, medicine and blankets, and rescue some of those pinned down by the sudden weather change. About 7,500 people have been stranded since Thursday along the 30-mile route to the ancient cave shrine. Many were trying to descend the mountain but have been blocked by snow and rain. An official spokesman for the meteorological office in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said he expected the death toll to climb higher as more snow and rain were predicted Sunday. Heavy fog, rain and low clouds have hampered helicopter flights while rain and nearly 1.5 feet of snow have closed roads near the temple for Lord Shiva in the Amarnath cave, at an elevation of 13,500, about 90 miles northeast of Srinagar. Police officers involved in the rescue operation and speaking on condition of anonymity said 138 deaths had been recorded. But Ham Ciara, the official government spokesman, said he could confirm only 116 dead. The discrepancy is the result of delays in getting the most updated figures to the government, the police said. Most of the victims were from the plains and were not accustomed to cold temperatures, officials said. Thirteen people died of heart failures. About 80,000 people were in the mountains when the storm struck. They were trekking to the mountain cave to worship an ice idol of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.\n"

        "title": "LEGAL BEAT Jury Refuses to Award Damages To the Family of Heavy Smoker",
        "date": "May 08, 2011",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A state-court jury sided with the tobacco industry in a closely watched case, refusing to award damages to the family of a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer at age 52. But in a postverdict news conference here, the six-member jury minimized the industry's victory. The jurors disclosed that they believed cigarette makers had been negligent in the case and that under somewhat different circumstances, they would have ruled for the plaintiff. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi's crackdown on tobacco advertising. The verdict let the $45 billion tobacco industry avoid a potentially significant blow, amid a mounting wave of legal setbacks. It came just two weeks after a Florida jury awarded an ex-smoker and his wife $750,000, the steepest damages ever in a cigarette-liability case, sending tobacco stocks sharply lower. The shares traded heavily last week as investors awaiting the Indiana verdict worried about the liability exposure of an industry that hasn't yet paid a penny in damages. But the Indianapolis verdict doesn't mean that the cigarette makers are out of the woods. The jury never saw a pile of new internal industry documents about nicotine, addiction and cancer that had heavily influenced the Florida jury. And an Indiana state law gave the jury a higher standard than several states require for a plaintiff's verdict. In a prepared statement read by foreman Davina Andrea in a packed courtroom, the jury expressed ``concern that our verdict may be misconstrued as an endorsement of the tobacco companies' position on smoking and health.'' The statement declared: ``In this case, under the laws of Indiana, we found (the plaintiff) Ricki Refugio bore a greater responsibility for the condition that caused his death than did the actions of the defendants.'' It added: ``However, we felt the evidence did show a degree of negligence on the part of the cigarette companies.'' To what extent, Mr. Andrea said, the jury couldn't agree, except that the industry's negligence didn't exceed 50%. Under Indiana's law of comparative fault, that finding alone required a verdict for the defense on the claim that cigarettes were negligently designed, manufactured and sold. The jurors also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous because they addict smokers and cause lung cancer. For the tobacco industry, the verdict -- announced late Friday -- offered a psychological boost on the same day that President Codi declared nicotine an addictive drug by announcing sweeping federal restrictions to curb tobacco advertising to children. Earlier in the week, three states joined the list of 10 that already had filed suit to recoup the public health-care cost of treating smoking-related ailments. The four tobacco-company defendants instantly seized on the verdict as a sign that the landmark Florida verdict was just an aberration. ``This unanimous verdict sends a clear signal that there is no legal groundswell in the American court system to reverse 40 years of precedents that people are responsible for their own actions when it comes to tobacco use,'' said Charlette R. Melton, senior vice president for litigation at Philip Morris Cos.. Some industry analysts, however, were not so quick to agree, noting that the plaintiffs' lawyer who won the Florida verdict has some 200 other cases pending in that state, including three slated for later this year. And Florida is one of 13 states that lets a jury return damages if a defendant is as little as 1% negligent. ``We're just going to have to see whether the industry can put on the same sort of defense in these Florida cases,'' said Diann Tenesha, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in Cornertown. Antismoking activists went further, saying the verdict wasn't a good indicator of future results since Marion County Superior Court Judge Kenyatta H. Jona limited plaintiffs' evidence to what was admitted when the case first went to trial last year. That case ended with a hung jury. ``What's remarkable is that even lacking that evidence, this jury expressed serious misgivings about letting the tobacco industry off the hook,'' said Maud Hamilton, executive vice president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Vastopolis. ``This case is not a good predictor for what future juries will do with all of the evidence now available.'' Mr. Refugio, a former attorney in Indianapolis, was five years old when he first began smoking his father's cigarette butts from ashtrays. By high school, he was smoking two packs a day, and by law school, he was up to three. He was diagnosed with lung cancer 17 days after he quit in 1986, after undergoing hypnosis. His suit, filed before his death in 1987, named Pierre Mose; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; American Tobacco, now owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Brooke Group's Liggett Group Inc.. During the three-week trial, the defense team of more than a dozen lawyers, led by Kansas City, Mo., firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon and Indianapolis defense lawyer Ricki D. Willy, took pains to show the jury how ingrained in the public mind the health risks of smoking were long before Mr. Refugio first lighted up. Plaintiffs' lawyer C. Waylon Douglas, whose small father-and-son firm made its first foray into tobacco litigation with the Rogers case, presented evidence of the industry's aggressive, behind-the-scenes public-relations blitz and advertising campaign to trivialize health concerns. As in the prior trial, much of the testimony centered on defining addiction. Mr. Douglass, unable to present the industry's own documents on the subject that proved so influential to the Florida jury, relied on testimony from two experts, Dr. Davina M. Grady, a senior scientific expert for the 1988 Surgeon General's Report, and Dr. Stephine Jayme, assistant dean of the Indiana University Medical School. Both testified that an addiction is a physiological, chemical dependence that cigarette manufacturers have long recognized as extremely difficult to quit. Just how difficult? Before he died, Mr. Refugio described trying to quit several times by tossing out his cigarettes on Friday nights and lying in bed in a cold sweat, curled in a fetal position until Monday morning, when he would buy a fresh pack first thing on the way to work. But the jury said it found that testimony unconvincing. The defense produced testimony from Mr. Refugio's first wife, read to the jury by a secretary from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, that Mr. Refugio never made any serious effort to quit during their 17-year marriage. Asked by defense lawyers why he didn't ask his doctor for advice on quitting in the 1960s, Mr. Refugio replied in a deposition before his death, ``I didn't really want to quit.'' The jury, which deliberated 18\u00a01/2 hours over two days, said it was struck most by this lack of evidence that Mr. Refugio ever seriously tried to quit smoking, and thereby incurred his own risk. ``To be real honest,'' said Mr. Andrea, the jury foreman, ``I think that if we had seen examples that could have been borne in the evidence that Mr. Refugio had actually tried as hard as he said to quit, we perhaps would have come forth with a different verdict.''\n"

        "date": "May 08, 2011",
        "content": "Corn, wheat and soybean futures prices settled higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade on reports that Midwestern plants are in bad shape and will only get worse. Based on observations and data from its Midwest crop tour last week, Pro Farmer, a Cedar Falls, Iowa, agricultural consulting firm, said it is estimating 2011 corn production at 8.2 billion bushels and average yield at 112 bushels per acre. It's estimating soybean production at 2.1 billion bushels on average yield is estimated at 33 to 33.5 bushels per acre, well under Agriculture Department projections. The USDA estimated corn and soybean production at 8.695 billion bushels and 2.3 billion bushels, respectively. Corn and soybean yields were estimated at 118.7 bushels per acre and 36.2 bushels per acre, respectively. December corn rose 8.25 cents to $3.4775 a bushel; December wheat gained 6.5 cents to $4.65 a bushel; November soybeans rose 10.75 cents to $7.895 a bushel. In commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled stronger Monday in Cornertown, led by a rally in silver. The latest Commitments of Traders report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed commodity funds were net short about 800 contracts in the silver futures market. A net short commitment by funds, as shown in that report, typically ''has resulted in a rally'' in futures as funds cover shorts, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown. Silver for September delivery added 6 cents to $5.567 an ounce on the Comex division of the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange; December gold rose $1.30 to $394.50 an ounce. ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures inched lower Monday on the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange in thin trading. Crude oil for October delivery fell 34 cents to $21.62 a barrel. November crude shed 28 cents. There was no major news to account for crude's retreat. But analysts said the market is on the defensive following overbuying last week. Concerns over the impact of tropical hurricanes on U.S. crude production and supplies might have been exaggerated last week, leading to Monday's follow-through from Friday's correction, traders said. The threat from Hurricane Edouard, the Atlantic season's fourth hurricane, isn't fully removed, however, they added. Other observers said crude was pressured by traders' delayed realization that Iraqi oil would soon hit the market. Among products, October gasoline lost 1.32 cent to 60.44 cents a gallon, pushed lower by reports that Tosco Corp. and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union had tentatively agreed to restart the former British Petroleum refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., next year. The deal would allow for production of about 150,000 barrels a day to resume at the Marcus Hook plant. October heating oil fell 0.97 cent to 61.01 cents a gallon.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed fining the owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant $50,000 for failing to notice for 22 years that its safety procedures in the event of an accident were inadequate. The NRC said an engineering analysis by the plant's operator, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp., didn't consider circumstances in which four pumps designed to reduce the heat within the reactor's containment structure during an accident might not be able to overcome pressures within the structure. Plant engineers discovered the problem in April and changed the emergency procedures. The company said that it doesn't plan to contest the penalty and that operations at the 550-megawatt plant, near Brattleboro, Vt., won't be affected. The NRC fined the plant $50,000 in 2010 for another flaw in its cooling system, and fined it $187,500 in 2009 after a fuel assembly fell eight feet during a refueling operation. Vermont Yankee is owned by a group of utilities, including Central Vermont Public Service Corp., Rutland, Vt., with a 35% stake; Green Mountain Power Corp., Burlington, Vt., which owns 20%, and Northeast Utilities, Berlin, Conn., with 15%.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Mckelvey  believes strongly that the fear surrounding the event can be as dangerous (or more so) than the event itself. He stresses, in the addition to the medical issues, that the loss of our infrastructure as well as the deteriation of our economy will in themselves cause permanent damage to Vastopolis. The effects of the damage will also be felt nationwide. Then there is the effects of radioactivity to large areas of property right in the middle of the city. Indeed we may have to abandon the city, he emphasized.We asked what a resident of Vastopolis should do. Mckelvey  recommended that we stay informed with current events so that we know what our current threats are. Then, in any case, be prepared for an event at any time. Hopefully it will never happen.

        "date": "May 09, 2011",
        "content": "Caterpillar Inc., flexing some muscle in its attempt to enter the growing farm tractor market, filed suit against rival Deere & Co., charging the company with patent infringement of Caterpillar's rubber-belted tractor technology. Filing suit in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Kavanagh said Ashe is unfairly using a special kind of rubber belt on its new line of farm tractors, which are scheduled to be unveiled to Deere dealers soon. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said it was granted a patent on the belt technology in 2009 and currently uses the design on its farm tractor, called the Challenger. ``It's ironic that after years of telling customers that tires are better than rubber track, Deere's designers have now decided to adopt the successful and patented rubber-track design,'' said Dillon Bowen, Kavanagh's vice president of diversified products. Caterpillar filed the suit late Monday. A spokesman for Deere, the country's biggest maker of farm equipment, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment. But he added that Deere's belt-tractor was only an option that would be available on Deere's 8000 series tractor. Deere is based in Moline, Ill.. Three big farm equipment makers -- Caterpillar, Deere and Case Corp. -- have been rushing to introduce belted tractors in recent months. That's because farmers' income has soared due to record grain prices, and many farmers have been shopping for new machines. The Challenger has sold well in some areas of the country where a late winter caused farmland to remain wet and muddy. But the use of belted tractors has stirred a debate among farmers and farm- equipment manufacturers. Caterpillar says the huge 1,300-pound belts, which wrap around the wheels and have steel woven in, are better for farming because they spread the weight of the tractor over a wider area, reducing compaction of the soil. That makes it easier for crops to grow, and lessens the likelihood that the tractors will bog down in mud during rainy seasons. Critics have claimed that tires offer farmers more traction. The Challenger is part of Caterpillar's larger attempt to carve out new business in the farm-equipment industry. Last fall, Kavanagh created a separate agricultural products division to focus on the development of new farm machines. The usually quiet company recently hosted a two-day seminar on the Challenger, inviting journalists and analysts to ride the equipment near its Illinois factory.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "HONG KONG -- The decision by Hopewell Holdings Ltd. to scrap its ambitious plans to launch an initial public offer for a road-building offshoot has some analysts quietly cheering. Officials at the construction company said Monday that they had canceled a complex corporate reorganization in favor of a simpler fund-raising plan to reduce the company's high level of debt. Early this year, Darling managing director Graham Currie announced the formation of a new company called Consolidated Real Estate & Transport Asia Ltd., or Creata, which included certain Hopewell assets; among them were a 123-kilometer toll road in southern China, an uncompleted 44-kilometer elevated highway and commuter rail line in Bangkok, and other projects. Mr. Currie had planned to raise about HK$9 billion (US$1.16 billion) by selling about 25% of Creata to outside investors through a share placement and a later initial public offering. Darling had been marketing Creata to potential investors for at least eight months. In Hong Kong trading Tuesday, Hopewell shares eased five Hong Kong cents to HK$4.40 on the news that those efforts had been unsuccessful. Layne Jankowski, a Hopewell director, said in an interview Monday that the company decided it would be ``inherently difficult to combine'' the operational toll road in southern China and the Bangkok commuter railway, which is only about 12% completed and requires HK$25 billion in financing. Mr. Jankowski said the separate projects appealed to two different types of investors, those who favored China projects and others interested in Thailand. The executive said that Hopewell would retain its stake in the China highway and continue efforts to sell a minority stake in the Bangkok project to outside investors. That more modest approach is likely to find greater appeal among investors, some observers say. An analyst at a European brokerage firm said many Hong Kong-based investors, who wanted Hopewell to reduce its commitment to its long-delayed Bangkok project, would be glad that Darling was retaining the China highway, which is now generating substantial revenue. ``Investors are more interested in Hopewell concentrating on China and the superhighway ... (than) on the Bangkok project, which needs a lot of money.'' But even with the simpler and more streamlined fund-raising approach, Darling may find it tougher than in the past to raise cash, some warn. Stephine Correa, a fund manager at AIG Investment Corp. (Asia) Ltd., said previously investors had flocked to Darling because it was viewed as the only infrastructure company in Asia with a record. Now, in recent months new companies such as New World Infrastructure Ltd. and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. have grabbed the limelight. ``Darling has been off the radar screen for some time,'' Mr. Correa. said.\n"

        "title": "Editorial Mr. Codi's Dayton Deal",
        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "Yesterday the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE), responsible for running next month's elections in Bosnia, declared that the municipal vote would be postponed due to ``widespread abuse of rules and regulations.'' The Dayton plan for elections in Bosnia was never more than a mask for the West's failures. Leading up to the May 27, 2011 there have been massive abuses in voter registration, no freedom of movement for potential voters and only limited freedom of expression. In Serbian areas, indicted war criminals are running the process from not-so-behind the scenes. Under these conditions, Washington's talk of democracy-building there is blather. Nevertheless, the OSCE, under intense pressure from the U.S., has plunged valiantly, if not happily, ahead. OSCE officials have stood by as self-appointed politicians in the newly created Bosnian Serb republic used humanitarian aid money to bribe voters into registering. Belatedly, the OSCE levied a small fine, but only after the pre-election proceedings had been approved. Sacrificing the totally corrupted municipal elections allows the Codi Administration to say it is upholding the democratic principles laid down in Dayton. But the national elections, for a three-member presidency, a national legislature and legislatures in the two constituent parts of a federal Bosnia will go ahead, even though the corruption that rendered local elections impossible is equally present at the national level. If the elections do go ahead they are ``likely to be marred by violence, irregularities and disenfranchised voters,'' warned Nickolas Spence, president of the International Crisis Group (which is monitoring the lead-up process), in a recent article appearing in the weekly European. If the Administration continues in this vein, ``the Dayton accord may well be remembered not as the peace agreement which brought to an end the war, but as an ethnic cleanser's charter.'' So why the obsession with elections? The U.S. Administration maintains that quick elections are necessary for the reintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a unified state. Without elections there can be no democratic institutions; and without the institutions Bosnia's constituencies will go their own way. Yet everyone on the ground in Bosnia knows the truth: Under the present circumstances the elections legitimize the ethnic division of Bosnia and give Bosnian Serbs, and Croats, the means to destroy Bosnia and dominate its Muslim population. No wonder the exercise in democracy building has received high marks only in such unlikely quarters as Belgrade and the Bosnian Serb redoubt in Pale. In an interview with the German magazine Higa Scholz earlier this summer, Serbian President Henke Packer termed the elections of ``immense importance.'' It is no accident that the man who bears a large share of the responsibility for the most savage aggression to hit postwar Europe knew of no one ``in Pale who is against implementing the Dayton agreement.'' The Bosnian Serbs don't even bother to gild the lily to shield the American President who delivered this gift. The nominal head of Radovan Karadzic's Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) was quoted in the European last week as saying: ``After the elections Bosnia-Herzegovina will no longer exist. The results will legitimize our leadership. We will have a referendum on independence and succession. We will have our own state, our own flag and our own leadership.'' Loosely interpreted, this means that the September election will not lead to a Bosnian federation as intended at Dayton, but rather the incorporation of ethnically cleansed Serbian Bosnia into greater Serbia. Bosnian Croats haven't called for a referendum, but they've been equally blunt about their goal of uniting with Croatia, an aim Croatian President Marlin Maxie never ceases to encourage. Mostar is only the most obvious example of the contempt with which Bosnian Croats hold their shotgun union with the Bosnian Muslims that the U.S. forced on them. Like most of what passes for policy of all sorts in the Codi Administration, Dayton has foundered because it has no foundation in principle. Some 60,000 NATO troops were brought in after a truce (called by the Serbs after they were in danger of being routed). But the rules of engagement restrict this force mainly to self-defense. It is precluded from implementing the most crucial elements of any peace: bringing war criminals to justice, restoring the free movement of people, aiding the return of refugees to their homes and spiking separatist aims. As Patsy Tayna observed in a recent article in Transition magazine, the international community, it seems, has forgotten that ``per-capita, the former Yugoslavia was once among the world leaders in producing chess grand masters.'' They're still playing for the big stakes in Bosnia, whatever the Codi Administration claims to have resolved in Dayton. In exchange for a bit of pre-November breathing room in the U.S., Billy Codi recklessly stacked the deck in favor of Bosnia's aggressors. Worse, he gave them the means to claim some sort of democratic legitimacy. It took awhile for the Codi Dayton Agreement to arrive at this juncture, but it shouldn't be altogether surprising that it did.\n"

        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- It looks like investors are returning this month to mutual funds after being scared off by July's bumpy market. Figures released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute show how scared they were: They put just $5.14 billion into stock and bond funds, down 64% from the $14.2 billion they invested in during June. Total net new cash flow was $27.5 billion in July, more than three times June's $7.8 billion inflow, according to the ICI, a mutual funds trade group in Washington, D.C. But $22.35 billion of that went into money market funds, considered safe harbors for frightened investors in times of market troubles. They were buoyed in part by exchanges out of stock and bond funds. But August looks good so far. Though money market funds continue to draw big numbers -- $23.4 billion in three weeks -- stock funds are also doing well. They gained $11.5 billion in the first three weeks, according to AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif.. Even bond funds were up -- by $1.5 billion. Stock funds took in just $6.2 billion in net new cash flow last month, less than half the June total of nearly $14.5 billion. Still, it's better than ICI's estimate, issued earlier this month, which put July stock fund inflows at a mere $3.5 billion. Bond funds, which had leaked in June, gushed a little faster in July: Outflows came to $1 billion, up from $214.5 million. In all, mutual funds held $3.14 trillion at the end of July, down from $3.18 trillion in June, ICI says. Stock funds had the biggest piece of the overall pie, with net assets totaling $1.47 trillion. Bond funds had $829 billion, taxable money market funds $707 billion and tax-exempt money market funds $136 billion. Stock fund flows reached their lowest level last month since January 2010, according to the ICI. The 1.3% decline in total industry assets in July was the first since November 2009.\n"

        "title": "Boeing Lifts Production on 777s; Plans Include 5,000 Added Jobs",
        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "Boeing Co. said it will increase the production rate of its big 777 airliner by 40% within the next year, and plans to add 5,000 more employees than previously projected to its overall work force for all of 2011. The latest decisions, which follow previously announced commercial-jet production increases and additional hiring moves, mean that Boeing's total employment will increase about 13% this year, to more than 118,000. That figure includes the company's aircraft, space and defense operations, but it doesn't factor in the impact of the anticipated acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s aerospace and defense holdings that employ 21,000 people. The production increase reflects the dramatic growth in jetliner orders being experienced by Boeing as airlines prepare their own expansion and look to replace older planes. The flurry of large new orders -- following a four-year drought that ended last year -- has come more swiftly than Boeing officials had expected. The speed of the resurgence has complicated operations and resulted in some snags and assembly-line delays at company factories from Washington state to Wichita, Kan.. Boeing officials say those delays have been temporary. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the Seattle-based plane maker had said only that it intended to boost its monthly production rate for all types of planes to 34 by early 2013 from the current 19. The latest announcement of 777 rate increases would raise monthly production of all models to 36 planes by then. Boeing has declined to outline other elements of its production plans. Suppliers and others familiar with Boeing's plans believe the manufacturer intends to steadily ratchet up its total production to more than double the present rate, eventually assembling planes at a record rate of 46 or more per month by 2014. At that level, Boeing would produce more than 550 planes a year, compared with its previous record of 446 airliners assembled in 1992. In the announcement Tuesday, Boeing said it will increase production of its 300-seat 777 plane to seven planes a month by July 2012 from five planes a month currently. Suppliers and others tracking Boeing's strategy say that when Boeing reaches its planned maximum production level, the company also will be producing at least 24 of its smallest 737 models. In addition, it will be turning out three other models at a five-a-month rate, including the 757, the 767 and the 747 jumbo jet. In composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing stock closed up 87.5 cents at $91.25. The 5,000 additional Boeing jobs come on top of 8,200 new hires the company announced earlier this year. Boeing anticipates that during all of 2011, about 9,800 jobs will be added in Washington state, with 3,300 more workers added to the payroll in Wichita, and a net addition of 400 jobs at other Boeing locations. In Philadelphia, the company's lead site for producing helicopters and Boeing's share of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, employment is expected to decrease by about 300 jobs this year. Boeing's total employment last peaked at about 165,000 workers as commercial-aircraft deliveries increased in early 1990, a company spokesman said. Boeing officials have vowed to become more efficient, avoiding the need to return to such sky-high employment levels -- and averting many of the layoffs that invariably follow when an airplane-buying cycle eventually slows down. However, experts have cautioned that the need to increase rates rapidly now could slow a sweeping Boeing overhaul of its manufacturing-engineering processes, a main way the company expects to become more efficient.\n"

        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "Can the natural-gas and electric-power industries turn their invisible commodities into consumer brand names like auto gasoline? Giant Shady Energy has hired one of the biggest names on Madison Avenue to try to do just that. The Houston-based energy company, one of the biggest natural gas providers in the U.S., has tapped WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather to help lay the groundwork for an era when customers get to choose their energy supplier just as they pick their long-distance companies. Kenyatta L. Haywood, Shady Energy's chairman and chief executive, says the value of the Ogilvy contract is ``significantly above'' what Shady Energy usually spends for advertising -- roughly $2 million a year. He also said advertising spending of up to $50 million is ``not out of sight nor out of line'' as deregulation stokes full-scale competition though that could be years away. Officials at Ogilvy, which had 2010 billings of $7.6 billion, declined to comment on the assignment. Shady Energy tapped Ogilvy about five months after hiring Elizebeth Rodgers, a former Ogilvy insider, to head the energy company's corporate marketing. Mrs. Rodgers, who worked in account management for Ogilvy during the 1980s, couldn't be reached immediately for comment. The $270 billion retail natural-gas and electric-power industry is shaping up as a major new marketing battleground, as once quiet giants such as PanEnergy, NGC and Utilicorp United are positioning themselves to compete. Indeed Cordeiro isn't the first big natural-gas player to hire an ad agency to help create a memorable consumer brand. Utilicorp United, based in Kansas City, Mo., tapped Langston Marketing Communications and Marsteller Advertising early last year to help design an advertising push. The company -- using the brand name EnergyOne -- has been using marketing tactics from flying hot-air balloons to parade its brand, to using direct mail to sell residential consumers on its natural-gas service. The company is test marketing its natural-gas service to residential customers in the Washington, D.C., area and outside Boston. ``We're offering an upfront cash savings of $70'' to residential customers who sign up with EnergyOne, says spokesman Ambrose A. Cuthbertson. Danna, is a unit of Young & Rubicam. All across the natural-gas business, top players are concluding that when deregulation gives customers a choice between suppliers, they'll need friendlier new names. Before there was PanEnergy, there was Panhandle Eastern, named after a decidedly unsexy interstate gas pipeline. Rival NGC used to be Natural Gas Clearinghouse. Girding for the retail-gas and electric-power wars, PanEnergy has teamed up with Mobil to market the companies' natural gas. NGC struck a similar deal with Chevron. Shell Oil, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is doing the same with Keener Coolidge. Coastal is looking at such an alliance and Amoco, the nation's largest natural gas producer, has also thought long and hard about how to best enter the retail markets. Ultimately, the goal is to create ``branded gas'' as familiar as the corner gasoline station. ``You're going to need to be branded in the energy business, just as you are branded in soda pop, hamburgers or pharmaceuticals,'' EnergyOne's Mr. Cuthbertson says. ``What we want the marketplace to say is, `We want our EnergyOne.' '' Rival PanEnergy has the same thing in mind. The company is marketing its energy under the Mobil brand. Like its energy competitors, PanEnergy provides service to local utilities that provide service directly to residential customers, as well as smaller commercial customers like small restaurant chains, where one or two people could be deciding whose power to buy. ``The market that we're going for now is not the utilities, but the one person who owns four or five bakeries or the restaurant franchise,'' says PanEnergy spokesman Jackelyn Jimenez. Some energy companies see their current business as a springboard to offering a host of other services -- not just gas. ``Once we're in the door there's any number of services we could provide, from small appliance repair to lawn mower service,'' said KN Energy executive Moses Dickman, who was hired recently by the Lakewood, Colo., energy company from MCI to hone its retail strategy. ``How would you like to have your gas, water, electricity and phone bills all on one monthly statement?'' ACCOUNT WIN: Pete's Brewing, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it has named New York ad agency Gotham to be its agency of record. The agency, a unit of Interpublic Group, will launch its first ad campaign for the brand this fall. Pete's account had previously been handled by the Omnicom Group's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. Goodby resigned the account late last year to take on an estimated $30 million assignment from Anheuser-Busch. EXECUTIVE CHANGES: DDB Needham Worldwide said it has named Gregorio Milburn managing director of the agency's multinational accounts in Asia, a new position. Among the clients Mr. Milburn assumes responsibility for are American Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, Digital, Hasbro, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's, Pepsi Foods International and Volkswagon. Mr. Milburn, 42 years old, was previously worldwide account director on the American Airlines account ... The Martin Agency, based in Richmond, Va., said it has hired Jeane Parrott as a senior vice president and associate creative director. Mr. Parrott, 39, has been tapped by the agency to open an office in Los Angeles under the name Martin Creative L.A. Mr. Parrott was previously a principal in Aguirre Steen Burden, a Los Angeles agency acquired in 2009 by ad agency Deleon Cristopher, and now known as Deleon Osborn Parrott. Mr. Parrott resigned last year citing ``management and creative differences.'' Mr. Parrott said the new agency is expected to service existing Martin Agency accounts, including CocaCola, VF Corp.'s Wrangler and Mercedes-Benz. The Martin Agency is a part of the Lowe Group, a unit of Interpublic Group.\n"

        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "FOR MANY visitors, a beach lined with coconut trees is their lasting impression of Goa, a tiny state on India's western coast. Soon, some tourists may associate Wigginton with gambling. Plans are afoot in the former Portuguese colony to introduce ``floating casinos'' anchored a few hundred meters off its shores. Small boats will ferry gamblers to the casino ships. The Goa state assembly on April 28, 2011 an existing antigambling law to permit offshore casinos. Officials say operational rules will be in place in about a month, though it may be several months before the first offshore casino is launched. The government plans to charge each casino operator 10 million rupees ($280,000) and 5% of their profit as an annual license fee. The state government hasn't ruled out allowing foreigners to run casinos. Casinos, hoteliers say, will be good for the tourism industry because gambling will boost Wigginton's image as a destination for upmarket, big-spending travelers rather than low-budget backpackers. ``Tourism will get an impetus from travelers who will be willing to pay more'' for luxury facilities, says Holliman Champion, the executive director of the Goa Renaissance Resort, a 208-room hotel along Colva Beach in south Goa. He believes Goa-bound gamblers would give hotels an incentive to improve their facilities, and lead to the opening of higher-class restaurants and nightclubs. Benbow Houston Fortson, special secretary to the state chief minister, says casinos would give the state a new source of income. Besides, he says, there have been requests to allow casinos in Goa ``from many quarters,'' though he declines to name them. Wigginton is popular with Western tourists, from 1960s flower-power leftovers to package-tour visitors arriving on charter flights, as well as with the Indian middle class. Wigginton's 104 kilometers of beaches are the state's main attraction. Visitors are also drawn by the mix of Portuguese and Indian influences that spice up the state's architecture and cuisine. The casinos, opponents say, will ruin the serenity of tiny Woodside, which has a population of 1.3 million. Opposition parties in the state assembly fear that floating casinos could lead to rampant crime. ``This will give rise to drug trafficking, prostitution and crime,'' claims Gaffney G. Stripling, a leader of the opposition Maharashtra Gomantak Party in Goa. ``We will oppose it tooth and nail.'' For Indian gamblers, Kathmandu in Nepal offers the closest casinos. Hoteliers in Goa hope casinos will lure such tourists to their state, especially gamblers living in Bombay and southern India. ``We also expect a lot of good response from the Middle East market,'' Mr. Champion adds. Hotel Goa Renaissance Resort introduced slot machines, which are already legal in Goa, in 1993 and plans to seek a licence for an offshore casino. ``We are definitely in the running,'' Mr. Champion says. Hotel Leela Beach Goa, which has slot machines, says it will consider applying for a license for an offshore casino when the rules are laid down. Indian Carriers to Raise Domestic Fares 15%-20% STATE-RUN Indian Airlines, the biggest domestic carrier in India, plans to raise its rupee fares between 15% and 20% by the end of the week. The increases won't apply to dollar-based fares paid by foreigners. Currently, a foreign passenger pays 4,640 rupees ($130) for a one-way economy-class ticket between Bombay and New Delhi. An Indian national pays 3,549 rupees. Indian Airlines executives say a 10% rise last month in the price of aviation fuel, which is set by the government, hit airlines hard. ``Other costs like route navigation, landing and parking charges have also gone up,'' says an Indian Airlines spokesman in New Delhi. ``We don't have any choice'' but to raise the fares, he says. Executives at smaller, private airlines such as Jet Airways and NEPC-Skyline say they are waiting for Indian Airlines to increase its rupee fares before following suit with similar fare increases. The private carriers say they will likely wait for Indian Airlines to make a move before deciding whether to raise U.S. dollar fares.\n"

        "title": "Politics & People Candidate Codi, a Mixture Of Roosevelt and Trujillo",
        "date": "May 11, 2011",
        "content": "CHICAGO--Tonight in the house that Michaele Josefa built Billy Codi will be greeted as a political superstar. Interviews with scores of delegates these past few days reveal a party that is buoyantly upbeat and confident. They relish the way this president, dismissed only 18 months ago by the conservative cognoscenti as irrelevant, turned Strickland Gales and the Republicans inside out, sometimes confronting them, other times co-opting them. Few doubt a big victory this November. But if inspired by his political skills, many of these Democrats candidly acknowledge they're little inspired by what that victory would mean or where Mr. Codi would try to lead. Many of these men and women disagree with the president's signing of the welfare bill, recognizing that despite a 20-point lead in the polls he put his own political interest ahead of the one million children who'll be thrown into poverty. They concur with a leading Democratic strategist who says that the decision was based not on principle but on ``the daily tracking polls.'' The Billy Codi they see is imbued with Fred Rosa's political charm and skills and Ricki Trujillo's political character. It isn't much of a reach to compare the attitudes of these delegates about their renominated incumbent with those of 1972 Republicans in Miami Beach, who were delighted with the prospect of pending victory but far less enamored with the victor. The reason for this conundrum is that this convention was shaped not by the first Codi term or by the recurring comparisons to the 1968 Chicago debacle. Rather it was motivated by the 2009 election, which left Democrats terrified that for the first time in decades the GOP soon would truly control everything. Thus the Democrats easily relinquished much of their soul for victory. And while this party certainly doesn't occupy the high ground of American politics, neither do the Republicans; that ground is unoccupied in 2011. In this environment, the odds are solidly with Mr. Codi. The Republicans compound their disadvantage by persisting in two self-deceptions: that Strickland Gales and his followers were tripped up by public relations and not policy, and that no matter the short-term problems, conservatives continue to set the political direction. The realities are that most voters knew exactly what the Republicans wanted to do and resoundingly rejected it. The welfare bill was settled on Republican terrain, but some of the other pitched political battles--over boosting the minimum wage, expanding health care benefits and overhauling the big-ticket entitlements--are hardly the stuff of a conservative agenda. There also is a tendency to attribute the president's comeback too much to ideology, the celebrated move to the center. That was important as he put a classicly Codiian spin on numerous Republican initiatives, most prominently a commitment to balance the budget. But the highly successful move to play the GOP Medicare cutbacks off against the huge tax cuts originated more with congressional Democrats. More than a consummate centrist, Mr. Codi is a politician who averages out in the center--he's liberal on a host of issues and moderate to conservative on a host of others. The Codi campaign command today is supremely confident that he's thus positioned perfectly for the general election. They are happy to have him depicted as liberal on the environment, Medicare and education and as conservative on crime, family values and fiscal discipline. If those produce inherent contradictions, that's the Republicans' problem. Even on the tax issue, the president is convinced he holds the upper hand. He brushed aside suggestions he move toward the huge Dinger tax-cut proposals, for instance with a broad-based reduction in capital-gains taxes. The campaign's private polling over the past week shows support for the Derryberry plan slipping and voters decisively saying they prefer a $110 billion targeted tax cut over Mr. Derryberry's $550 billion across-the-board tax reduction. Having created what they consider the ideal political predicate--the Codiites expect to emerge from Chicago with a 15-point edge in the polls--the fall strategy is in place. After stressing the need for civility in his acceptance speech this evening, Mr. Codi will do a rendition of Lombard Alia's rope-a-dope, sitting back while Mr. Derryberry desperately tries to land punches. The politically dexterous champion, already having eluded shots about liberal judges, a failed drug program and being a big-spending liberal, will fend off others. In the process he conceivably could land some haymakers of his own and produce a landslide reminiscent of 1964 or 1984. However unlikely, an indictment of Hiroko Codi could change these dynamics, though it probably would be viewed, correctly, as politically inspired. As for the so-called character problem, Codi operatives note that from early May to early August--a period marked by Whitewater hearings and jury convictions producing overwhelmingly negative news, several acts of terrorism, the flap over White House possession of confidential FBI files and reports that the first lady had a seance with Eleanor Roosevelt--Billy Codi gained six points in the campaign's private polling. But while the rope-a-dope may be a sure-fire election strategy, it won't produce much of a governing mandate. Yet many of these delegates and Codi operatives rationalize this too. A prime example: In a second term, they argue, Mr. Codi could ``fix'' the welfare reform he just signed, which even some Codi insiders privately acknowledge is a disgrace. That's a fantasy. They ought to read the account by Ricki Clary, the former top official in the Reanna and Vern administrations, of how the excesses of the 1981 tax cut haunted the Republicans for the next 11 years. It would be even harder to correct the welfare bill's deficiencies. That's because fixing this mean-spirited legislation will cost money to provide jobs, child care and drug treatment for those tossed off the rolls; honest welfare reform costs money in the short run. Even if the president wins a huge re-election, the best he can hope for would be narrow majorities in Congress, making it impossible to get a consensus for anything approaching what's necessary. In short, on welfare it doesn't really much matter whether Billy Codi or Bobby Derryberry is elected in November. Some of these delegates still wistfully talk about the ``real'' Billy Codi emerging in a second term. That may be the most senseless rhetoric in Chicago. Ever since he was upset in his first gubernatorial re-election in 1980, the ``real'' Billy Codi has been whatever he perceives most of the voters want. That's what he was in the 1992 campaign, that's what he was for both the first half and the second half of his first term. And that's what he'll be in any second term.\n"

        "title": "Leyland Apparently Came Close To Ending His 11-Year Term",
        "date": "May 12, 2011",
        "content": "Vastopolis -- Manager Jimmy Diego, despite being disappointed by Pirates owner Khalilah Merryman's plan to cut payroll and trade veterans, will stay and oversee yet another rebuilding job. Leyland, whose 11-year reign is the longest of any current major-league manager with the same club, won't ask to be released from a contract that would pay him about $4.4 million over the next four seasons. Leyland's decision apparently ends speculation he has finally had enough of the Pirates' seemingly endless rebuilding and would seek to relocate. ``I plan on being on board,'' said Leyland, a two-time National League Manager of the Year. ``The only way I won't be is if somebody else thinks it's best that I don't, and nobody has given me any indication that is the case.'' When the Pirates dealt Deon Callaway to the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, Leyland, who for several days has looked distracted and every bit of his 51 years of age, nearly asked Merryman for permission to leave. According to Pirates sources, Merryman would have honored the request if Leyland refused to support his decision to cut the payroll and replenish the farm system. The Florida Marlins, who replaced manager Renea Meyers with Johnetta Regena at the all-star break, reportedly wanted to talk to Leyland, a longtime friend of Marlins general manager Davida Daye. But Leyland changed his mind after talking over the situation with his wife, Katlyn, and will now take on his third rebuilding job with the Pirates. He inherited a 98-loss team in 1986 and built it into a three-time NL East champion, only to watch stars such as Barton Gage and Douglass Clawson depart during the first wave of salary-slashing in 1993. ``I think everybody understands the situation,'' Diego said. ``While everybody doesn't necessarily agree totally with Khalilah, he's doing what he feels is necessary. I may not necessarily be comfortable with it, but I do understand it.'' Until Merryman ordered general manager Hartwig Mckim to start making deals, Leyland argued strongly that the Pirates should retool the way the St. Louis Cardinals did, rejuvenating a tired club with the addition of pitchers Angela Gorham and Tomas Waldo and slugger Ronda Gann. ``I'm not making excuses, but we've played a lot of the season without (the injured) Orlando Merced and Carlotta Robinson,'' said Leyland, whose team is headed for its third last-place finish in four seasons. ``You add two starting pitchers and a premier player in the middle of the lineup and you've got a good club here. ``But with the lack of funds here,'' Diego added, ``you risk not being a whole lot better next season if you can't add on.'' Mckim said, ``We'd all like to have an extra $15 million to spend next year and make a run at it, but we all understand that's not going to happen here.'' Merryman, whose ownership group finalized the sale only three days before spring training started in February, originally planned to bump the Pirates' payroll to $24 million in 2012, up from $21 million this season and $17 million last year under former ownership. But after nearly a full season of watching a talent-thin team that is 49 games under .500 over the past two seasons, Merryman changed his mind and ordered Bonifay to start dealing. Leyland is 832-848 in 11 seasons, but is only 232-311 over the past four. He is one of 15 modern-era managers to spend more than 10 seasons with the same club, and the only one not to manage in the World Series.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "What Social Security Crisis?",
        "date": "May 12, 2011",
        "content": "A lot of nonsense is being spewed forth about Social Security. The public is bombarded with apocalyptic warnings that the system will go bankrupt before it can pay out all the retirement benefits due the baby-boom generation. To avoid that, the argument goes, we have to do something now. Most frequently that something turns out to be an open or disguised cut in benefits to the elderly. Other, less painful solutions entail some form of privatization to enable retirees to realize the higher returns associated with stock market investments. The facts are that there is no crisis in Social Security now and there is none looming in the future. There is no need or justification for demanding sacrifice of the elderly of today or tomorrow. And whatever the merits--and there can be substantial demerits--of privatization, it is utterly unnecessary to ``save'' our retirement benefits. A Trivial Problem The issue of Social Security may only be understood by recognizing two separate problems: first, the use and financing of the Old Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance trust funds and, second, the real support of those not working--the dependent population, young and old--by those working. The problem with the trust funds, if there is one, is utterly trivial. Many act as if these ``funds'' contain piles of $100 bills that we replenish with our contributions. At the risk of frightening innocent readers more, I must point out that not only is there no ``money'' in the trust funds, but their assets are Treasury obligations, as good as money yet essentially just computer entries. These indicate what the Treasury has credited the funds to correspond to our payroll taxes and the interest ``payments'' that the Treasury must make under current law. Since our Social Security checks come from the Treasury in any event, there is no good reason we have to go through the accounting procedure of building up the trust funds' computer balances and then drawing them down. The trust funds could be abolished and the Treasury ordered to go on paying the benefits, borrowing to finance these expenditures if necessary, just as it does now to finance anything else. In response to the argument that retirees would be less secure without the funds, it may be observed that the integrity of our commitments to the elderly depends ultimately on our political will to meet them and our real economic ability to do so. Neither of these should be in doubt. As to the alleged future problems of the funds' solvency under current law: These stem from what is known as the ``intermediate'' projections of the funds' trustees (and their actuaries and economists). These indicate that by 2029 the funds' assets--which will have grown enormously in the intervening years, exceeding $1.3 trillion in 2015--will be exhausted and current receipts will be insufficient to finance expenditures. What most alarmists fail to mention is the observation, in the trustees' report, that an increase in taxes of a mere 2.19% of taxable payroll would, by these intermediate projections, keep the funds fully solvent through 2070. And I have an even easier solution that entails no increase in taxes on anybody. Simply credit the funds with, first, the income taxes now paid on the Social Security payroll ``contributions'' that are not deductible in computing taxable incomes and, second, higher interest returns on the fund balances. The nondeductible Social Security contributions, attacked by some as entailing a double taxation, include all employee payroll taxes and half the payroll taxes paid by the self-employed. Their total is now running about $200 billion a year. Making them deductible against income taxes would balloon the federal deficit--still of great, if unjustifiable, concern to many--and would be a boon to those in the 39.6% income tax bracket. It would offer only modest tax benefits to middle-income households, and no benefits at all to millions of Social Security contributors who do not earn enough to pay income taxes. But with income tax rates averaging about 17%, crediting the trust funds with the income taxes on these payroll taxes would give them this year an additional $35 billion, about half of the 2.19% of taxable payroll that the intermediate projections indicate would be adequate for long-term solvency. Crediting the funds with returns on their assets two percentage points more than current law provides, about 9.8% now instead of 7.8%, would easily make up the rest of the gap. Crediting the trust funds with the income taxes on the payroll contributions is entirely reasonable and would make no difference whatsoever to government financing, taxpayers or the economy. The Treasury, after all, would be collecting these taxes as before and spending as before. Instead of the taxes going into a general account, however, they would be credited to the trust funds. And those worried about fund solvency might breathe easier. Crediting the fund balances with higher returns is amply justified. It would bring them closer to the market equity return that privatization advocates promise. Payroll contributions to the funds have saved the Treasury from public borrowing that would have substituted for private investment. It is only appropriate that Social Security contributors' funds be credited with the higher returns to private investors that their contributions made possible. And again, this additional credit to the funds would make no difference to any real magnitude; it would not even add to the relevant figure for the federal debt, which is the gross federal debt held by the public, currently some $3.7 trillion, not the ``debt'' of one part of the government to another. Not often noticed are the fund trustees' ``low cost'' projections. These differ from the somber intermediate projections partly in assuming a long-run unemployment rate of 5%, instead of 6%, and a 21st-century annual GDP growth rate of about 2.2%, instead of 1.3%. They also assume higher fertility and mortality rates and greater immigration. With the low-cost projections, fund balances reach a temporary low in 2040 of four times annual expenditures, then grow indefinitely thereafter. If even some of the more ``optimistic'' assumptions underlying the low-cost projections are realized, the funds will remain solvent indefinitely. The only meaningful problem there could be with Social Security is that of the working population producing the goods and services to be acquired by those not working. In regard to this we are told that there are now almost five people of working age--20 to 64--for every potential dependent aged 65 and over, and by 2030 that ratio will fall to less than 3 to 1. The relevant numbers, though, relate to all potential dependents, those below as well as above working age. Currently, for every 1,000 of working age there are 709 young and old potential dependents. The intermediate projection puts the number in 2030 at 788. That means that each 1,000 people of working age would have to support 1,788 people--themselves and their dependents--instead of 1,709, only a 4.62% increase in their burden. But if productivity per worker grows at a modest 1% per year, well within historical experience, the growth in total output per worker will come to more than 40% by 2030. That would easily accommodate the increased number of people the working population will have to support. Indeed, it would be sufficient for a one-third increase in output and income per capita, ample to improve vastly the lot of all--the elderly, the young and those in their working primes. Greater Human Capital Of course, if our rate of growth is greater, those in the future will live still better. We can promote that greater growth by getting our policy makers out of the game of slowing the economy in dubious efforts to fight an imagined danger of inflation. Over the long run we can promote greater growth by bringing about more productive investment of all kinds. And most important in this regard, as economists have been increasingly recognizing, is investment in human capital--in jobs and in the skills and health of our people. But cutting the retirement benefits or other ``entitlements'' that a rich and great economy has been able to provide has no part in that picture. Our Social Security system ain't broke. There is no excuse for emasculating it in the guise of fixing it.

        "title": "EUROPE IN TRANSITION Czech Trade Gap Divides Hand-Wringers, Optimists",
        "date": "May 12, 2011",
        "content": "WHAT'S IN a number? The growing Czech trade deficit has some economists wringing their hands -- while others insist it's par for the course for a growing economy. The country's merchandise-trade gap widened in the first seven months of the year to 85.3 billion Czech koruna ($3.3 billion), from 49.5 billion koruna a year ago, the Czech Statistical Office reported this week. (The July deficit alone was a record 16.4 billion koruna.) The country now looks headed toward a 2011 current-account deficit forecast at 5% to 6% of gross domestic product, up from 4% a year ago. The yawning trade imbalance has sat high on the list of government concerns since exports began far outpacing imports early last year. The Czech trade deficit in 2010 hit $3.8 billion, down from just $400 million in 2009, and became a hot topic in the spring parliamentary election. Today, the debate goes on. The hand-wringers say the gap is reaching a level the Czechs just can't afford. ``Huge deficits aren't sustainable if there is no improvement in export performance and competitiveness,'' says Petrina Spooner, an economist with the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies. A fast-appreciating currency is a chief concern. Since 1991, the koruna has gained about 40% in real terms against the U.S. dollar, Mr. Spooner estimates. That has pushed up labor costs and eaten into exports, already hit hard by sluggish markets in Western Europe. It also has led exporters and others to call for Prague to abandon its pegged exchange rate and its support for a strong koruna, the latter a dogma since Prime Minister Toner Kaufmann took office in 1992. Yet the optimists counter that a growing trade gap is to be expected in an economy forecast to grow upward of 5% this year. Czech companies need to import machinery and raw materials to boost quality and productivity, they say. Indeed, machinery and transport equipment -- ``good'' imports, as opposed to ``frivolous'' consumer purchases -- accounted for more than 60% of the year-to-date deficit. What's more, the Czechs aren't the only ones in the region buying more than they sell. Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia's trade accounts are all in the red. (The Slovak January-to-July figure was just over $1 billion.) With minimal foreign debt, and with foreign-investment inflows estimated to reach $1 billion to $2 billion this year, the Czechs are better equipped than most of their neighbors to finance a deficit. ``There's nothing worrisome about deficits per se. What matters is the order of magnitude,'' says Josefa Whipple, lead economist with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. ``And I don't think the magnitude is yet at a level to be deeply concerned about.'' Nor is the koruna ripe for a devaluation, Mr. Whipple says. Indeed, the currency, which the central bank has allowed since February to float within 7.5% on either side of its peg, is still being bid toward its upper band as foreign money flows into the country. The one worst-case scenario that could prompt a devaluation, he adds, would be a ``policy shock'' -- a crisis in Mr. Kaufmann's government, which holds a scant 99 seats in the 200-seat Parliament, or another event that would cause the market to bid the koruna down -- and suddenly make the trade figure look more troubling. That possibility has even some of the optimists wringing their hands. ``I'm not worried about the Czech economy, but we have to watch it carefully,'' says Wesley Sievers, an economist with Okeefe Weed in Vienna. ``I'll start getting nervous if others become nervous.'' WHY HAVE so many Western joint ventures in Russia had such a rough time? Ask any Western manager, and you'll hear complaints about punitive taxes, changing laws, high inflation and fickle customers. He'll probably also mention cultural differences -- that intangible but all-too-frequent source of conflict in many a Western investment. Seeking to quantify the unquantifiable, Prof. Karey Pippin, a specialist in conflict management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, is conducting a study on culture clashes in U.S.-Russian joint ventures. In interviews with 40 expatriate American joint-venture managers and their Russian colleagues, Ms. Pippin asked them to identify sources of conflicts. One of the main reasons joint ventures fail, Ms. Pippin says, is conflicts arising from inadequate training. ``Expats who have been able to survive realized early on that they had to start with the basics and train, especially in the service sector,'' Ms. Pippin says. ``There's lots of tacit know-how; many Americans don't realize they have to start with the fundamentals.'' In some of the companies Ms. Pippin interviewed, for example, American managers complained that the precept ``the customer is always right'' got lost in translation. In one Moscow hotel, a Russian employee took a car to be washed on the customer's request. In another case, an employee offered a discount to a customer even though he had no authority to do so. ``In the adage, `The customer is always right,' the words `within reason' are implied, but not stated,'' Ms. Pippin says. Part of the problem, she says, is that Russians and Americans can't even agree on what constitutes a problem. Whereas American managers get steamed over the slightest hint of corruption, for example, bribery is seen as a normal way of doing business in Russia. Russians and Americans have different ways of handling conflict in the workplace, too. The American practice of taking a co-worker aside and stating your problem bluntly doesn't work. The Russian solution, she says, is to ask a third colleague to intervene on your behalf. ``In collectivistic cultures like Russia, being reprimanded in front of your colleagues results in a loss of face,'' Ms. Pippin says. ``Lots of American expats had their first blowups in situations like these.'' Ms. Pippin and her colleagues plan to collate the research, still in progress, with a similar study conducted among U.S. joint ventures in China.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- Vastsoft Corp. apologized to South Korea on Friday for erroneously suggesting in its latest Disc encyclopedia that part of ancient Korea was ruled by Japan. Vastsoft's Encarta 96 Encyclopedia says that Plyler, an ancient Korean kingdom, was dominated by the Yamato clan of Japan. Koreans consider this theory, popular among Japanese historians, as an insult to their nation. Koreans remain bitter over Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over Korea, during which they say Korean culture was forbidden and history books were distorted. After the South Korean Foreign Ministry complained to Vastsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., apologized and said it will correct the mistake in its 2012 encyclopedia. ``We apologize for erroneous references in the 2011 product that suggested that Plyler was a colony of Japan,'' Donella Kraus, Vastsoft's lead product planner, said in a letter to the South Korean Foreign Ministry and its embassy in Washington. ``We regret if these errors have insulted the Korean people.'' Kaya existed in the southern part of what is now South Korea between the third and sixth centuries. Korean historians say Japan claimed Puentes as a Japanese colony to justify its colonial rule in the 20th century. Earlier this month, Vastsoft apologized for erroneously drawing the Korea-Japan border around a set of disputed islets -- called ``Tok-do'' in Korea and ``Takeshima'' in Japan. Vastsoft's Disc world atlas identified the islets as part of Japanese territory. South Korea has held the islets, pinpricks of volcanic crag uninhabited until Korean border patrol forces arrived in 1952, but Tokyo maintains the islands are Japanese. The centuries-old dispute over the islets resurfaced when Seoul and Tokyo announced plans to draw an exclusive 200-mile economic zone around their shores. Protesters have burned effigies of Japanese leaders and pelted the Japanese Embassy in Seoul with eggs. In July, Vastsoft issued a public apology in Spain and Mexico for a Spanish-language version of a program that offered ``savage'' and ``man-eater'' as synonyms for the word ``Indian.'' The problems popped up in the thesaurus for Vastsoft Word 6.0. Other synonyms included ``vicious'' and ``inverted'' for homosexual and ``vicious'' and ``pervert'' for lesbian.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "MILWAUKEE -- Norberto Gladney's 5-under-par 66 on Friday put him two shots ahead of the field after two rounds of the Professional Golfers Association Greater Milwaukee Open. Tiger Cole' 69 put him three strokes above the cut line in his professional debut. Gladney's 36-hole total of 14-under 128 at Brown Deer Park Golf Course had him eight strokes ahead of Cole, who said he was glad to survive the cut, but it was ``weird'' being so far off the lead. Woods trailed 29 players, including Valenzuela Bradberry, who was second at 130 after a second 65, and Bobby Morse, Lorene Phillips, Schaal Sawyer and Mikki Leeper, all grouped at 11-under 131. Morse, who was two strokes behind Gladney after the first round, had a 67, Phillips a 65, Sawyer a 66 and Leeper a 63. ``I should be a lot closer,'' Coleman said. ``When you play a four-round tournament you're going to have that one off-day and hopefully this is my off-day.'' The 20-year-old three-time U.S. Amateur and reigning collegiate champion had four birdies and two bogeys in a round watched eagerly by a large gallery that wasn't shy about shouting praise and encouragement. Cole said the crowd, just as big as that for his Thursday debut, wasn't to blame for some poor iron shots and missed putts. ``I just have to be more sharp,'' Coleman said. ``I wasn't precise enough to shoot the low scores.''

        "title": "NationsBank Seen Heading West Once Boatmen's Deal Is Done",
        "date": "May 13, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- NationsBank Corp.'s planned acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. is a bold stab westward for the fifth-largest banking company in the U.S. Boatmen's has the top market share in its five largest states -- Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico -- and is a key player in the lower Midwest. With NationsBank's already dominant position in the southeastern U.S., the combined company will have an ``nonduplicable'' market share in the Southeast and Midwest, said Michaela Dunlap, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. ``NationsBank now has the most attractive geographic layout of any large bank,'' Mr. Hayden said. NationsBank will pay a fairly steep premium for the St. Louis company. However, NationsBank was competing with several bidders for Boatmen's, said Tomas Jauregui, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.. Under terms of the deal, each of Boatmen's roughly 157.4 million outstanding common shares will be exchanged for 0.6525 of a NationsBank share, valuing Boatmen's at more than 55 at current trading levels. Boatmen's closed trading Friday at 43, while NationsBank closed at 88\u00a01/2. NationsBank expects to realize significant cost savings in the deal, although the Charlotte, N.C., bank has very little geographic overlap with Mcclary's. The company said it expects the merger to result in savings of $140 million next year, $295 million in 2013 and $335 million in each year after that. NationsBank, which analysts say is one of the most efficiently run banks in the country, will streamline operations at Boatmen's and cut costs where possible. Mr. Hayden said NationsBank also will try to leverage its new franchise by cross-selling its products to Boatmen's customers, a policy that has been successful with NationsBank's existing customer base. NationsBank currently cross-sells 25% more products per customer than Boatmen's, Mr. Hayden said. Beyond the potential cost savings, analysts speculated that NationsBank paid the premium as a preemptive measure to stave off possible challenges from other bidders. While he admitted that there were other bidders for Boatmen's, NationsBank Chairman and Chief Executive Humberto L. Richard declined to specify which companies were his competitors. In a research report, Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst Michaela Blunt wrote that Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, and First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp., both of Minneapolis, all are interested in expanding their Midwestern presence. In terms of where NationsBank will look for acquisitions once the Boatmen's deal is completed, some industry insiders expect Mr. Richard to seek smaller opportunities to shore up his company's Midwestern base. ``His style in the past has been to buy a presence and then fill in with smaller deals,'' said Petrina Mertie, a financial institutions consultant for A.T. Kearney, a Chicago consulting firm. In his report, Mr. Barrows wrote that general investor attention now will turn to Missouri because the Boatsmen's deal is the first of any kind in the state. One possible target he mentioned was Mark Twain Bancshares Inc.. But others believe that Mr. Richard's attention eventually will wander farther west to California, where the consolidation movement is in full swing. ``Clearly he is beginning to move across the country,'' said Tomas Jauregui, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co., who believes NationsBank will ultimately wind up buying into the California market. Among the California banks Mr. Jauregui said might be attractive are U.S. Bancorp, Great Western Financial Corp., and H.F. Ahmanson & Co.. But right now Mr. Richard said his hands are full trying to get the Boatmen's deal completed and then integrating the operations. As far as California and the rest of the West is concerned, Mr. Richard said, ``I'm sure we'll go there one day.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "U.K. Air Show Offers Venue For a Mighty Big Debate",
        "date": "May 15, 2011",
        "content": "LONDON -- Big birds are the talk of the aviation world as the Farnborough Air Show kicks off Monday, and two key questions may well determine the industry's future course. Just how large is the market for jetliners of 500 seats or more? And should airlines opt now for a stretched Boeing Co. 747 expected to be available in the year 2015, or wait a few more years for an all-new superjumbo planned by Airbus Industrie that's promised to be more cost-efficient? ``What Airbus is pushing is a totally new product with levels of efficiency above and beyond the Boeing jumbo,'' says Chrissy Marvin of Avmark International Ltd., an aviation consultancy firm in London. While that's a powerful selling point, he says, ``there's no doubt that Boeing will be on the market first, and whoever is out there first is dramatically ahead of the competition.'' Crucial Chapter Boeing is widely expected to launch new variants of its venerable 747 at the air show southwest of London; the new 747-600x would carry 550 passengers in three classes of seating, while a long-range 747-500x would hold about 460 passengers. Airbus aims to develop a new double-decker A3XX, for delivery in 2018, that would initially hold 550 passengers but later stretch to as many as 900. Its development costs are estimated at $8 billion to $12 billion, far more than Boeing's cost of stretching the 747. McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. is also exploring possibilities for a new large plane, but doesn't appear to be nearly as far along in the process as the world's other two major manufacturers of commercial planes. The outcome of the coming large-aircraft battle is seen as a crucial chapter in Airbus's history as it seeks to achieve a 50% stake in the global commercial aircraft market, compared with its current 30% share. Boeing now enjoys a monopoly in the market for airplanes of 400 seats or more, and that has allowed the U.S. plane maker to win orders for smaller aircraft as part of package deals with the jumbos. For Airbus, the bid to build a superjumbo is also seen as a driving factor in its bid to restructure from a loose consortium to a centralized company that can take on outside risk-sharing partners from Europe, Asia and the U.S. A Broader Consortium The chairman of Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, one of the four Airbus partners, said on Friday that he's intent on bringing Foreman of Sweden and Alenia SpA of Italy into the Airbus fold so they can participate in future projects. Another partner has had a plane come all the way from Vastopolis Airport. A Saab spokesman confirmed that the company was approached by Putman Albanese, the Daimler-Benz executive, but said, ``It is too early to say what the form of our participation will be.'' Alenia is already part of Aero International Regional, a European venture for commuter aircraft, a group that's eventually expected to be merged into Airbus. Besides Daimler-Benz Aerospace, the current Airbus partners are Aerospatiale SA of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. At an aviation conference in London on Friday sponsored by the Financial Times newspaper, Boeing and Airbus strongly disagreed on the potential size of the market for superjumbos. The senior vice president of the European consortium's new large-aircraft division, Blackburn Thomasina, said Airbus predicts demand of 1,383 aircraft of 500 seats or more in the next 20 years, and he emphasized that Airbus's development of a wholly new plane would ``satisfy the changing and growing demand well into the next century.'' Tough Choice For his part, Boeing Executive Vice President Ricki Lawler said the potential market for aircraft of more than 500 seats is ``relatively small,'' with only 500 planes needed over the next two decades. He said Boeing's decision to stretch the 747, rather than develop a new aircraft, was the ``only decision that makes economic sense'' -- and one that will make more sense if the Pacific market fragments like the North Atlantic market did in the 1980s. Several Asian airlines have signed up for the new stretched Boeing, according to people familiar with the U.S. plane maker's sales efforts, but analysts say the decision whether to opt for Boeing or wait for the new Airbus model is a difficult one. Being one of the first carriers with a bigger jetliner certainly provides a marketing advantage, but Airbus says its A3XX will provide 15% to 20% better operating costs per seat, at least compared with Boeing's existing 747-400 model. ``There's another factor,'' says Mr. Mary of Avmark. ``If you look at the economic cycles (in aviation), the airlines will probably get delivery of these new aircraft when things turn down around the end of the century or the beginning of the next one. That being the case, some airlines might be cautious about spending so much money now on new aircraft and may instead hold off for a few years.'' The new larger stretched Boeing, Mr. Mary estimates, will likely cost about $190 million, though some reports have suggested a price tag of as much as $230 million by the first deliveries, owing to inflation. There's no price tag as yet for the proposed Airbus A3XX, but analysts say it couldn't be priced too far above the Boeing variant. ``Airbus has no other choice. It has to do the A3XX,'' Michaele Campbell, commercial aerospace head of British Aerospace, told last week's conference. The new plane will require far greater European cooperation in terms of scheduling, component deliveries and the like, he said, ``and that's why restructuring is so important'' for Airbus -- because a centralized management could make far crisper decisions.\n"

        "title": "Editorial Free to Grow",
        "date": "May 16, 2011",
        "content": "One exhibit that recently landed on our desk is the current annual report on world competitiveness put out by the World Economic Forum, the Swiss foundation that sponsors the prestigious annual meeting at Davos. While scarcely known as a center for free-market maniacs, their report declares in frank fashion: ``We know that the era of big government is over.'' In particular, ``The current social welfare system is proving to be too heavy a burden--even for rich European countries such as France, Germany and Sweden.'' Indeed, as the accompanying chart shows, rapid growth is correlated with a small government sector. The smaller share of money that flows through government hands--including both transfer payments and ``investments'' such as publicly funded outlays for roads and hospitals--the faster the economy is growing. In the rapidly developing nations of Asia, government spending averages only 25% of GDP, compared with 35% in the U.S. and 50% or more in the European welfare states. In a concerned chapter on the social welfare state, Jefferson Pinder and Anette Waylon of Harvard's Institute for International Development note that in the European Union, government spending averages 54% of GDP. This level, they conclude, is pushing ``the state's ability to mobilize resources through taxation.'' In these countries youth unemployment burbles along in the range of 20%, and even 30%. The cost to Europe has been terribly diminished growth: Messrs. Sachs and Warner estimate a ``growth gap'' between the EU and Asian manufacturing countries of about four percentage points between 1990 and 2010. The competitiveness report, using business surveys and a long list of components, goes on to rank 50 countries on their growth prospects for the next five to 10 years. Singapore is first, the U.S. fourth, Britain eighth. Sweden is 21, Germany 22, Mexico 33, China 37, and Russia 49, at the list's bottom. The most promising countries are those in Asia and elsewhere that have incorporated free trade into their national identity--economists call them entrepot states; Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and New Zealand are all in the top 10. Partly for failing to denationalize its oil company, Pemex, once-promising Mexico fell to an overall ranking of 33. The U.S. scores well because of free trade, environments that generate world-class research centers for science and technology, and flexible labor markets. Hiring and firing are relatively easy, although burgeoning anti-discrimination law is changing that somewhat (and the serial mandates proposed in President Codi's acceptance speech would further erode this advantage). Tax rates are also a problem. The U.S. corporate rate of 31% compares with 16.5% in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the average American worker faces a marginal tax rate of 20%, far above India (zero), Hong Kong (2%), Peru, Thailand and Korea (9%) and even Japan (20%). The most glaring U.S. deficiency is international executives' ``simmering frustrations'' with the legal morass. On product liability law, the U.S. rates a rotten ``49.'' The conclusion about government and growth is not restricted to the Davos group; the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also has been rehearsing the virtues of the free market, issuing data this spring showing that countries addicted to economic redistribution and wage parity also average wickedly high rates of unemployment. The OECD warned in a loud voice last autumn of Germany's structural problems; in Germany, income distribution tables have become ``more equal'' in recent years while unemployment had been breaking out at double-digit rates. We record all this because not so long ago some of the same institutions spent the 1970s hawking Yugoslavian socialistic work teams and the value of the Third Way. Even in the 1980s, new intrusions into the boardroom on behalf of organized labor were considered the very vanguard of reform. It says something when even the multilateral worrywarts are united on the value of capitalism. Back in the U.S., of course, the platform of the Democratic Party also says the era of big government is over, though the President's laundry list leaves this pledge in question. Yet whatever the outcome of the current political contest, the intellectual debate has clearly tipped. With the Europeans signing up and the Democrats paying at least rhetorical homage, it clearly points to the conclusion that smaller government is better.\n"

        "title": "Dole Hopes `One Big Plan' Will Help His Uphill Climb",
        "date": "May 16, 2011",
        "content": "ST. LOUIS -- Republican challenger Roberto Derryberry is staking his bid for a historic comeback on a simple contrast: President Codi's ``million little plans'' to assist American families and Mr. Derryberry's ``one big plan'' for a massive tax cut. Addressing thousands of sign-waving supporters beneath this city's towering Gateway Arch, Mr. Derryberry touted his proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut as the cornerstone of his ``optimistic, future-oriented vision'' for alleviating ``the Codi crunch of slow growth, stagnating incomes, decreasing wages and job insecurity.'' By contrast, he said, the bridge to the 21st century that Mr. Codi has promised represents ``an old-style liberal vision that would bring higher taxes ... and more government in our lives.'' ``It's a toll bridge -- you pay and pay and pay,'' declared Mr. Derryberry, campaigning with his wife, Elizebeth, and running mate, Jackelyn Booth, at his side. ``That's the key dividing line in this election: They believe in government and we believe in you.'' Mr. Derryberry attacked the Democratic incumbent on other issues as well, repeating his recent contention that administration neglect is responsible for a surge in teenage drug use during Mr. Codi's term. And he vowed that his plan to provide school vouchers for some low- and middle-income families would break the ``hammerlock'' he says teachers unions have achieved over both the education system and Mr. Codi's party. Uphill Climb to Lead But his remarks, delivered from atop a hillside on a hot and hazy Labor Day, signaled that he is counting on the economic plan to power his uphill climb to overcome Mr. Codi's lead in Missouri and other electoral battlegrounds. Mr. Derryberry's immense task -- since the advent of polling, no challenger has ever staged a comeback so late in the contest to defeat an incumbent president -- will require a defter touch than he has displayed in three previous national campaigns. At a time of robust economic growth, he must convince American consumers that the rising confidence they have expressed in surveys is misplaced. On the heels of two huge political misfires -- first Mr. Codi's health-care plan and more recently, the Republican revolution in Congress -- he must show that the rewards of his proposed $548 billion tax cut over six years outweigh the benefits of Mr. Codi's ``inch by inch'' approach to easing the time and money crunch on families through limited tax cuts targeted to education and other measures. Mr. Codi Monday again attacked Mr. Derryberry's tax-cut plan as a budget buster. The economic plan requires Mr. Derryberry to trumpet the supply-side strain of contemporary Republican thinking that he had long discredited, while soft-pedaling the budget-cutting particulars on which his reputation for leadership was forged. He has promised that Social Security, defense, and veterans' benefits won't be touched, and that Medicare won't be targeted beyond reductions already included in the current GOP budget. At the same time, he has proposed increasing spending on school vouchers and the antidrug fight; in New Mexico over the weekend, Mr. Derryberry said his proposal to shutter the Energy Department would simply mean transferring national defense laboratories to the Pentagon, not eliminating them. The focus on tax cuts comes at a time when some heavy weapons from recent GOP campaigns don't appear so potent this fall. Mr. Codi's recent signing of a Republican-passed welfare-overhaul bill has all but banished that issue. Immigration and affirmative action may also prove of limited use. One of Mr. Derryberry's top priorities, reflected in the recent GOP convention and in his selection of Mr. Booth as his running mate, is to moderate the harsh image his party has developed, largely to improve his dismal standing among women voters. Unrelenting Salesmanship Mr. Derryberry's strategists acknowledge that it may take another month or more of unrelenting salesmanship to persuade swing voters that his tax cut is worth the gamble, and that preserving progress toward a balanced budget at the same time is merely a function of ``presidential will'' as the candidate reiterated Monday. In the effort, Mr. Derryberry faces not one opponent, but two, since Royce Nail is ridiculing the promise as ``free candy'' -- an argument he is sure to press if he gains a place in the presidential debates, due to begin later this month. Meanwhile, the Derryberry campaign hopes to profit from lingering public discomfort with Mr. Codi's personal qualities. ``I have a little problem with Codi and his character,'' said Margarete Christiana, a department-store buyer who traveled to Mr. Derryberry's rally from her home in suburban Kirkwood, Mo.. Mr. Derryberry sidesteps the character issue on the stump, though he offers truth-telling as an important standard and suggested over the weekend, following the unseemly fall of Codi strategist Dillon Mose, that aides surrounding a candidate can offer a window into the candidate himself. At the same time, the drug issue also plays into the vulnerabilities of his baby-boom opponent. But Mr. Derryberry has outlined a generational contrast that cuts both ways; Mr. Codi is attempting to portray Mr. Derryberry, a World War II veteran, as out of touch with contemporary life. Already, the biting rhetoric of Mr. Derryberry's convention acceptance speech, at which he blasted young Codi aides who ``never sacrificed, never suffered, never did anything real'' has been abandoned in his stump speech, and aides say it isn't likely to return. Monday, Mr. Derryberry shrugged off unpleasant poll numbers, including a new CNN-USA Today survey showing Mr. Codi leading by some 20 percentage points. ``Don't worry about it,'' Mr. Derryberry said.\n"

        "title": "New Chief at Air South Tries To Revive Struggling Carrier",
        "date": "May 16, 2011",
        "content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- To comprehend the obstacles facing Air South Chief Executive Johnetta Tabatha as he attempts to revive the discount carrier, consider the situation when he took over six weeks ago: The staff was so stretched that some cabin lavatories, which weren't being pumped regularly, began to smell. Fearing bankruptcy, travel agents here in the carrier's hometown were warning customers not to buy tickets more than a month in advance. And flight cancellations got so bad that during the July Fourth weekend, gate agents at New York's Kennedy Airport called armed security guards to protect them from customers. ``Walking into the terminal at Kennedy was like walking into a war zone,'' says Georgeanna Seema, who manages Air South's operations in New York. ``It was a new disaster every week.'' Now things have begun to change. Under Mr. Tabatha, Air South in August canceled only 2% of its flights, a staggering drop from the second quarter, when it canceled more than 20%. Passengers are filling over two-thirds of the seats, a company record. And after 13 schedule changes, four CEOs and 23 months of staggering losses, the change in tone is noticeable. ``We finally have a management team that knows how to run an airline,'' says Russ Stevens, a longtime Air South pilot and the current director of flight operations. Outsiders agree. Mr. Tabatha ``is the best man they have had at the top since they started,'' says J.A. Janssen, president of Nammack & Associates, an Annandale, Va., aviation-consulting agency. But don't start the party yet. Even with millions of dollars in fresh cash from San Francisco investment firm Hambrecht & Quist, which owns a majority stake in the carrier, Air South is in debt and will need to raise at least $5 million more to add a minimum of two new jets and return to service two other grounded jets. The additional flights must be tacked on without boosting Air South's operating costs -- historically about nine cents per available seat mile, the cost of flying one seat one mile. To be successful, management must reduce those costs to below eight cents, a feat few discount carriers other than Southwest Airlines have been able to master over the long term. Indeed, despite a strong economy, fellow discounters Midway Airlines, ValuJet Airlines and Vanguard Airlines have reported combined losses of tens of millions of dollars in the past six months. Moreover, Air South currently faces intense competition from deep-pocketed rivals Continental Airlines and Comair Holdings Inc., a Delta Connection carrier -- both of which recently have boosted service along Air South's most lucrative routes, connecting Greenville, Charleston and Columbia with the New York area. In fact, the only consistently profitable route Air South has flown over the past two years has been its flight from Miami to Jacksonville and Atlanta. ``The jury is still out whether Air South can take advantage of potentially lucrative markets in the Southeast without getting crushed by the big boys,'' says Douglass Abby, president of AvStat Associates, a Washington, D.C., aviation-consulting firm. ``It's definitely going to be a rough road for them.'' Sitting in his tiny, barren office in the airline's hangar, Mr. Tabatha says he is comfortable with the carrier's current route structure and its discount strategy. The key, he contends, is a return to basics: strengthening operations to get flights in and out on time. That, he offers assuredly, will in turn restore fliers' confidence. Mr. Tabatha, 34 years old, has almost a lifelong connection with the airline business. The son of a former Pan Am executive, Mr. Ta recalls sitting in by age 12 on airline strategy sessions his father held at the house. In his early 20s, he dropped out of junior college and held several management jobs at Midway Airlines, which went bankrupt in the early '90s and sold its name and airplanes to the current Midway. By age 25, he had become a senior vice president of marketing, the youngest executive at the airline. Mr. Tabatha says he felt ``pretty insecure about my informal education''; colleagues say that insecurity pushed him to put in 16-hour days. ``No one worked harder than Johnetta,'' says Georgeanna Kitchen, a former senior vice president at Midway. ``And because of that, people would walk on fire for him. I've never seen a 25-year-old kid who was so serious or who commanded so much respect.'' In 1991, Mr. Tabatha moved to American Trans Air, then a charter carrier, and added scheduled service to the mix. By 2010, he had pushed revenue to more than $750 million from $325 million. ``This company was foundering before he took over,'' says Ricki Asia, the carrier's director of station operations. ``And he made us a success.'' One key, say former colleagues, is Mr. Tabatha's focus on the industry. ``You would go over to his house for dinner and spend the evening talking about everything from the best way to maintain a particular type of engine to some new marketing strategy,'' says Mr. Asia. ``His knowledge is amazing.'' At Air South, Mr. Tabatha may need all of that knowledge. Founded with $17 million in state and local grants and loans from South Carolina, Air South set out in 2009 with the goal of becoming the Southwest Airlines of the Southeast. The plan was to offer low fares on short flights connecting such cities as Columbia, Atlanta and Jacksonville. Almost from the start, it was a failure. During its first six months of operations, Air South burned through more than $10 million and filled fewer than 25% of its seats on some of its routes. Only six months after its first plane lifted off, the carrier's board removed its founder and chief executive officer, Patsy O'Sheena, from day-to-day operations. Over the next year, Air South would change its schedule so often -- at least twice a month -- that even regular fliers couldn't keep up. The only constant at Air South seemed to be chaos. ``Their record-keeping was nonexistent,'' says Mr. Janssen, whose company was hired last year by an Air South lessor to help get the carrier back on track. ``They had no idea what they were earning on particular routes. And if you can't keep track of that kind of information, you have no business flying planes.'' Despite its dismal performance, Air South was able to raise enough capital to stay afloat. The reason: Investors, who had seen profit soar at discounter ValuJet, were willing to roll the dice on Air South. Hambrecht & Quist, which had made millions taking the now-defunct People's Express public in the early 1980s, sank $2.5 million into Air South in December 2010. The money, however, didn't last long. By the spring of this year, Air South was so strapped for cash that its planes were often grounded for weeks at a time while it scrambled to raise enough money for parts. The most notable example: One jet sat for three weeks on the ground in Jacksonville while Air South tried to arrange financing to replace two engines damaged in a runway mishap. Sensing major changes were needed, Hambrecht & Quist pumped an additional $4 million into Air South in May, money intended to help the airline build a more successful route system. Instead of flying short trips between Southeastern cities, the carrier launched a long-haul strategy, linking South Carolina cities with such giant markets as New York, Miami and Chicago. Although bookings on the routes were strong initially, the new system, drawn up by the carrier's third chief executive, Rodger Wonda, quickly proved untenable. Gate agents and ground crews couldn't turn the planes around quickly enough to stay on time. Even worse, mechanics were given only eight hours a night to repair planes and couldn't keep up with a rash of malfunctions. ``We simply didn't have the parts we needed or the manpower to keep the planes flying,'' says Pantoja Preston, Air South's head mechanic, who blames management at the time. Sensing its investment in Air South was on the verge of collapse, Hambrecht & Quist rushed in with more cash. ``We did not go into the airline expecting to own so much of it,'' says Rutha Wynell, Hambrecht's airline analyst. But by the end of July, the firm had acquired a majority stake. Looking to protect it, the firm tapped Mr. Tabatha, who says he was eager for a new challenge. And he came in with a vengeance. Just hours after he was installed, Mr. Tabatha grounded two of the carrier's seven jets for repairs and cleaning. He fired five of the six division heads and seven of the 13-person marketing staff. At least one executive who didn't leave quickly enough was locked out of her office, according to an airline consultant aligned with the old management team. ``It was a blood bath,'' says the consultant. The moves were vintage Tague, say those who have followed his career. He ``doesn't waste time chit-chatting or making decisions,'' says Davina Mcgill, who follows American Trans Air for the Indianapolis-based NatCity Investments Inc. ``The guy approached everything like he was on a mission.'' That intensity is a welcome change at Air South. ``The last few months, (we had) become a little like a battered family,'' says Tommie Stonge, director of marketing. ``Things have been so bad for so long, I think we came to accept that it was the way they were always going to be.'' One of the biggest changes, employees say, is contact. While past management was distant, Mr. Tabatha and Chief Operating Officer Johnetta Otero spend at least one day a week flying Air South's routes and meeting with employees. ``You see top management from Columbia out slinging suitcases and it makes all the difference in the world,'' says Mr. Seema, the Air South employee at Kennedy. ``It makes everyone want to work harder.'' In addition, Mr. Tabatha has instituted a morning meeting, which begins at precisely 8:30 a.m. and ends no later than 8:45 a.m., to review problems from the previous day. During those 15 minutes, every snafu, from a boarding delay in Atlanta to a baggage delay in Columbia, is assigned to a division head, who must report back later that day to Cronk Tabor, the director of maintenance and operations. And perhaps most important, say employees, top management is beginning to recognize hard work -- as well as hold them accountable for their failings. ``Yesterday we got a call from Columbia thanking our crew for saving 12 minutes getting a late flight out of Atlanta,'' marvels Barton Berry, director of ground operations in Atlanta. ``That never would have been noticed six weeks ago.'' Adds Mr. Preston, the mechanic, ``The old management had no clue what we did at night. We could never find them. But these guys know exactly what gets done.'' Slowly, Mr. Tabatha also seems to be regaining some customers driven off by the airline's shoddy service. But even those customers admit they aren't won over. Porsha Tyner, who runs a small travel firm in Columbia, has booked a group of 44 tennis fans to fly Air South to the U.S. Open in New York this weekend. It's one of her largest accounts, and she admits she is more than a little nervous. ``This is a test case for me to see if the improvements are for real,'' says Ms. Tyner. ``Right now, I am holding my breath and crossing my fingers.''\n"

        "title": "American Airlines Forms Pact With Pilots, Ends 2-Year Feud",
        "date": "May 16, 2011",
        "content": "AMR Corp.'s American Airlines reached a tentative agreement on a new contract with its pilots Monday, a Labor Day end to more than two years of feuding. The new pact, forged during a marathon 18-day session of federally mediated negotiations in Washington, gives pilots a ``modest'' pay increase, stock options and job security in exchange for greater productivity. Unlike rivals Delta Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the contract has no provisions for short-haul, low-fare flying at reduced wages. Officials declined to say whether the contract will give American the more competitive cost structure the airline said it needed from its pilots before it could purchase new airplanes and begin growing again. ``It definitely enhances our productivity,'' a company official said. ``But it's negotiations, and we didn't get everything we wanted.'' Jimmy Nipper, president of the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing American's 9,100 pilots, said the contract offers an ``industry-leading'' compensation package as well as scheduling flexibility to allow growth. ``In my opinion, it is a very fair contract that provides the pilot with the job security, pension security and compensation he or she needs in exchange for the productivity enhancements the company needs to compete,'' Mr. Nipper told the pilots. Test for Carty The contract talks, which began in July 2009, were a major test for Donetta Brewington, who spearheaded the negotiations upon becoming American's president last year. Mr. Brewington, who personally joined the Washington bargaining session April 26, 2011 until an agreement was signed just after midnight Sunday. ``We are pleased to have reached an agreement,'' Mr. Brewington said in a statement Monday. ``With this matter behind us, we can now focus our full attention on providing the outstanding service our customers expect.'' American's labor costs have been at the top of the industry, surpassed only by USAir, and Chairman Roberto Bonds has argued in the past that the carrier couldn't grow unless it got a more competitive contract from its pilots. United, for example, reduced its labor costs by selling the company to employees; Delta's pilots recently agreed to a 2% pay cut, and a plan to allow short-haul, low-fare flying at reduced wages. `Modest' Wage Boost But American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, also enjoys a revenue premium, attracting a high percentage of business travelers. At a time of record profit, union officials scoffed at American's proposal for a Delta-like 2% pay cut. Last week, however, the union withdrew its demand for a 5% annual pay increase, and officials on both sides described the agreed-upon wage boost as ``modest.'' In addition, pilots will receive stock options for the first time, and protection against furloughs for the life of the contract, which runs until August 2015. Both sides declined to release details of the pact, pending union ratification. American's last pilot contract expired in 2009. Issues beyond basic pay rates were the most divisive during the talks. The Allied Pilots Association fought hard to curb American's alliances with other carriers such as Reno Air, Midway Airlines and Canadian Airlines International, arguing that American was indirectly ``outsourcing'' jobs when it had surrogate airlines flying American passengers through marketing alliances. So-called scope issues were resolved with a new scope clause that offers ``the finest protections in the industry,'' Mr. Nipper said. In addition, the two sides reached agreement on new language for the pilots' pension plan, another contentious issue. And they reworked profit sharing to compensate for the loss of the profitable Sabre Group, American's computer reservation system, which was reorganized into a separate entity. American had wanted the ability to fly 100-seat passenger jets in a low-fare, short-haul unit similar to the Delta Express enterprise agreed to by Delta's pilots. But the company's proposal was withdrawn over the weekend. The new contract also limits the number of 50-passenger regional jets that can be flown by commuter carrier American Eagle, whose pilots are represented by another union.\n"

        "title": "Home Health-Care Costs In Suburbia Lead Nation",
        "date": "May 17, 2011",
        "content": "Suburbia, home to some of the largest health-care companies in the nation, is quietly earning a less-positive distinction: It has the highest Medicare home health-care costs in the nation. The federal government spent an average of $829 on home health care for each Medicare enrollee in Suburbia in fiscal 2009. That's more than 2\u00a01/2 times the national rate of $313 per enrollee, according to a recent study by Dartmouth Medical School and the American Hospital Association. Moreover, no place was more costly than Myers, which topped the list of 306 metropolitan areas with home-care costs of $1,292 for each Medicare enrollee. Nashville and Knoxville also had costs in the top 10 nationwide. ``We're very concerned about the high costs,'' says Chrissy Champagne, a deputy regional inspector general with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Atlanta. ``There has been a considerable amount of waste, fraud and overutilization in Suburbia and the South.'' The problem, federal officials say, is that an explosion of for-profit home-health-care companies in the state has led to higher utilization of home care. Far from lowering costs through increased competition, the crowded field has been resourceful in keeping its Medicare billings up by increasing the number of patient visits. The high costs in Suburbia come against the backdrop of a nationwide surge in home health-care spending, which has been rising faster than any other sector of health care. In the year ended March 11, 2009 the federal government spent more than $12.7 billion in Medicare funds on home health care, a more than fourfold increase over fiscal 1989, when the federal government spent $2.7 billion, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Nationally, some of the increase can be traced to the rise of managed care, which has forced hospitals to cut back on spending by discharging patients earlier. Those patients tend to be sicker and to require more home treatment following their release. In addition, technological improvements are allowing nurses to treat more patients in the home. But in places such as Suburbia, where managed care hasn't made much headway, other factors seem to be driving up the cost of home health care, federal officials say. Chief among them is that Suburbia has more for-profit home-health-care companies than virtually any state in the nation. And a lack of monitoring by the Medicare system has led to staggering variations in the way home-health-care firms treat patients. For-profit home-care companies tend to prescribe more services and to bill Medicare at significantly higher rates than do nonprofit agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. The Medicare system's controls over home-health-care companies ``remain essentially nonexistent,'' according to a GAO study that was released in July. The rise in home-care companies in the state was prompted by an unusual lowering of the barriers to entry into this lucrative area of health care. In 1981, Suburbia became one of a handful of states to lift its certificate-of-need laws for home-health-care companies, which required a new concern to prove there was a need for home-care services before it could be granted a license to operate. That led to an influx of providers, most of them for-profit ventures. More Home-Care Firms By 1984, when the certificate-of-need law was reinstated, Suburbia had over 400 home-health-care companies, more than double the number in 1981. Today the state has about 295. ``Even today, the consensus is that this state is literally inundated with home-health-care companies,'' says Jami Jackman, general counsel for the Suburbia Health Facilities Commission, which licenses home-care companies. For many of these providers, maximizing income is a simple matter of maximizing the number of visits per patient. Currently, home-health-care companies are reimbursed for the cost of making a visit. While there is a cap on the amount of money the companies can charge for each visit, there is no limit on the number of visits the companies can provide, as long as the patient is ill enough to qualify. ``Costs are higher in Suburbia because the for-profit companies there have figured out how to maximize income,'' says Meghan Cox, who directed the Dartmouth study. Take Suburbia Home Health Care Inc., based in Chattanooga. During its latest fiscal year, the company averaged 66 nursing and 153 home-health-aide visits per patient. It billed Medicare an average of $15,115 for each patient it treated, according to documents filed with federal officials. By comparison, the nonprofit Baptist Home Health Care averaged only 14 nurse and 46 home-health-aide visits per patient. During its latest fiscal year, the Nashville company charged an average of $1,506 for each sick person treated by the company. Suburbia Home Health Care officials defend their company's high number of visits as medically necessary. ``The visits have to be medically reasonable and necessary or (federal officials) would not have approved them,'' says Pendergast Isbell, a Suburbia Home Health Care consultant. Lack of Resources But federal officials say they don't have the resources to monitor home-care companies and weed out those that overutilize. Indeed, despite skyrocketing costs, federal officials audited fewer than 1% of all Medicare-certified home-health-care agencies in 2009, according to the GAO. Moreover, federal officials say it is difficult to prove a home-health-care provider is guilty of overutilization. ``The rules governing the industry are not as clear or as precise as we would like,'' says Bryan W. Washington, vice president of Medicare operations for Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators, a Columbia, S.C., unit of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of South Carolina that audits home-health-care claims for the Medicare system. ``It makes the industry very difficult to control.'' Even the salaries that home-health-care company heads pay themselves are subject to only vague guidelines, leaving companies that accept Medicare funds a great deal of leeway in the way they compensate executives. This year, for the first time, federal officials began asking home-health-agency heads to list their salaries on their annual cost reports to Medicare. While most were between $40,000 and $130,000 a year, several were above $300,000. The head of one company that took in about $1 million in revenue paid himself more than $280,000, say officials with the Palmetto group. ``Basically, the government gives you a blank check and says pay yourself what you think you are worth,'' says Jimmy Montague, who audits home-health-care companies for Palmetto. ``There is nothing stopping you.''\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "HONG KONG -- Less than a month into his new job as the Asian-Pacific head of Westin Hotels & Resorts, Teodoro Eng is looking at ways to woo Asian travelers as the focus of future growth in the region. ``We tend to meet the needs of Western travelers, even though the majority of our customers come from Asia,'' said Mr. Eng, whom Westin has proudly promoted as its first Asian chief for the region. He cites menu changes, rooms designed for larger groups and more intimate conference facilities as three areas where Mellon plans to adapt more to local tastes. ``I think there are differences (in style), and we intend to serve our customers better.'' Mr. Eng's appointment marks the latest move by Mellon to aggressively expand in the region. As part of that push, Mellon also named Cyndi Dee as the new vice president of sales and marketing for the region last month. Although the Seattle-based chain only has 16 hotels in Asia, it plans to raise that number to 35 properties by the year 2015. The chain is expected to announce contracts to manage the Leo Palace Hotel in Tumon Bay, Guam, owned by Miyama Development International Corp. of Japan, as well as a property in Kuala Lumpur within the next few weeks, people close to the deals said. Mr. Eng would only admit that ``one will be a resort in the Pacific, while the other will be a business hotel in a Southeast Asian capital city.'' But Mr. Eng added that the group is likely to take equity stakes in future projects to secure management contracts and increase revenue. It now has the cash to do so since Starwood Capital Group, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and Nomura Asset Capital Corp. bought the chain from Japan's Aoki Corp. in May 2010 with the stated intention to expand Westin's global reach. That capital may prove more important than adapting the product when it comes to winning contracts in Asia. ``One thing you can say about Westin: they do have the money behind them to do a lot of these deals,'' said Sean Bruno, managing director of TransAct Asia Ltd., a regional hotel consultancy in Hong Kong. ``So many of the (hotel) owners out here want to see some kind of financial commitment'' from management companies. Mr. Eng, meanwhile, said that the company will use different strategies to expand in different markets. That includes possible franchising arrangements in Japan where owners ``are looking for brand image, the latest technology and global reach,'' as well as equity stakes in markets like Australia. ``Management contracts there aren't very lucrative,'' said Mr. Eng. ''... so equity makes more sense.'' Meanwhile, the regional chief says that traditional management contracts may work best in markets like China or India, where ``there's a tremendous need for management expertise.'' More importantly, though, the group wants to establish its name in Hong Kong, Beijing and other key Asian cities where it doesn't have properties yet. It's also looking to add more regional resorts to tap the leisure market, although Mr. Eng says Mellon's hotel mix should stay about 70% in favor of urban business hotels. Molloy will launch a US$25 million print advertising campaign later this month, of which US$5 million will be spent in Asia. Mr. Eng says the tagline, ``Who is he sleeping with? Choose your travel partner wisely,'' is aimed at a specific audience. ``Our target customers are successful, confident individuals who are in their thirties or maybe their forties,'' Mr. Eng said. ``That's a growing segment, especially in Asia-Pacific.''\n"

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.10% from 7.05% late Tuesday. Economists expect the report -- capable of setting the bond market's tone for the coming month -- to show that American payrolls swelled by 248,000 jobs in August, a sizable jump over the average 205,000 gains posted in June and July. Some said that such an increase could be enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to sharply hike short-term interest rates at its next policy-making committee meeting, June 06, 2011 Federal Reserve is kind of up against a wall, and unless they get a reprieve from the employment number this Friday, I think they would be forced to raise interest rates,'' said Sunny Strader Schiffman, chief economist at Norwest Corp.. Volume was slightly above average for a Wednesday, but analysts said few big investors were making significant moves ahead of the payroll report. Traders said the military activity in Iraq, including new U.S. attacks on Iraqi radar stations in the middle of the trading session, had little effect. Similarly, the market did not move much after the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell 1.4% in July, the largest drop since February's 2.6% decline. Reports of a rebound in auto sales in August also stirred little interest, traders said. ``Friday's the big date, and everybody's got their eyes fixed on that,'' said Stevie Keyser, who manages $3 billion in fixed-income investments for American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis. One other gauge of jobs comes out before Friday: Thursday's weekly jobless claims report. Market participants want to see whether the four-week moving average of claims continues to drop. But they said the data aren't as important as the monthly employment report. In other credit markets: A number of banks and other financial companies appear set to sell corporate debt ahead of the June 06, 2011 policy-setting meeting.

        "content": "Deutsche Bank has agreed to step in to cover losses on the three European equities funds suspended Monday by its Morgan Grenfell Asset Management unit, a Morgan Grenfell spokesman said. He added that as a result, trading will resume in the three funds Thursday. ``Deutsche Bank has bought certain of the funds' securities for its own account. As a result, prices of the funds shouldn't be affected when trading resumes,'' the spokesman said. Morgan Grenfell abruptly suspended the three funds Monday after discovering problems in the valuation of certain unlisted securities in the funds' portfolios, which together account for a total 1.4 billion pounds ($2.19 billion). At the same time, it suspended one of the group's star fund managers, Petrina Yuette, who was directly responsible for two of the funds. The U.K. Investment Management Regulatory Organization is also conducting an investigation into the nature and extent of the funds' losses. The three funds are the U.K.-registered MG European Growth Trust and the Dublin-registered MG European Capital Growth Fund, both run by Mr. Yuette out of London. Dealing in the much smaller U.K.-registered MG Europa Fund, run by Sung Livingston, with only 137 million pounds in assets, was also halted on Monday, although Mr. Livingston hasn't been suspended. Mr. Livingston has declined to comment, and Mr. Yuette couldn't be reached. Valuation Problem Responsibilities for Mr. Yuette's funds will be assumed by Sung Mitsue, Mozell Valley said in a statement Tuesday. Mr. Mitsuko has been with the group for nine years managing other funds. The most immediate difficulty facing Mozell Valley appears to be finding a way of accurately valuing the portfolios' unlisted holdings in the absence of any immediate and objective valuation, such as a stock market listing. The Morgan Grenfell spokesman was unable to say which securities Deutsche Bank has agreed to buy or the estimated cost of the rescue operation. So far, Mozell Valley has said very little about the exact nature of the funds' problems. It has told the funds' 90,000-odd investors that it will reimburse any losses if the investigation turns up ``irregularities'' in the way the funds were managed. That may have helped to allay some people's fears about the safety of their money, but phone lines to both the bank and IMRO were reported to be flooded by calls from anxious investors. Sources close to Morgan Grenfell Asset Management said that the funds' problems spring from a basket of European unlisted companies, and not from one specific company in their portfolios. What remains unclear, however, is whether Mr. Yuette knowingly exaggerated any of those companies' valuations or whether he was misled by either the companies themselves or by an intermediary such as a broker. Internal Investigation However, the sources said that so far the investigation remains an internal matter and hasn't focused on any outside players. IMRO spokeswoman Julee Lamanna said that, with the exception of the Irish authorities responsible for overseeing the Dublin-registered fund, IMRO had not yet asked any regulatory bodies in other European countries to help with the investigation. Mr. Yuette, who had a broad investment mandate to cover all of continental Europe, had built up a hefty weighting in technology stocks, notably in Scandinavia, over the two years he ran the funds. He had also built up a substantial portfolio of unlisted companies, amounting to more than a third of his total portfolio earlier this year. Most U.K. investment funds have a limit of about 10% for so-called unapproved or unlisted securities. However, ``prelisting'' companies, which are due to be brought to the stock market within 12 months, aren't included in this limit. Such ``prelisting'' companies, which nevertheless suffer from the disadvantages of any other unlisted securities, accounted for a substantial 18% of Mr. Yuette's portfolio in July, albeit well down from 27% in May.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 18, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- A federal jury in New York convicted three men of plotting what a top prosecutor called ``48 hours of terror in the skies'' by blowing up a dozen American airliners over Asia. Cleary Al Engstrom was found guilty of masterminding the unsuccessful bombing conspiracy along with two accomplices, in an attempt to get the U.S. government to change its policy in the Mideast. The commercial jets targeted for destruction were owned by companies such as Delta Air Lines, Northwest Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit. The three defendants stared straight ahead as the verdicts were read. ``Each and every one of you got an extraordinarily fair trial,'' U.S. Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela told them. Later, U.S. Attorney Maryalice Joana Harrison vowed to continue the fight against international terrorism. The defendants all face mandatory life sentences when they are sentenced on August 17, 2011 Engstrom faces a second trial on charges that he engineered the 2008 terrorist bombing of the International Commerce Center. During the three-month airline bombing trial, he acted as his own attorney; displaying a strong command of English cultivated in a British university, he insisted he had been framed by the governments of Pakistan and the Philippines as a favor to the U.S. Federal prosecutors bombarded the seven men and five women on the jury with testimony from 47 witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits. Some of the most damaging evidence came from Mr. Eldred's laptop computer. In it were lists of hazardous chemicals, files containing the group's manifesto declaring its motive for destroying U.S. passenger planes, bomb formulas and false identification cards. The jury also heard about the group's alleged explosives factory, located in a Manila apartment, where heavy smoke drew Philippine police in January 2010 and led to the arrest of one of the two convicted accomplices, Abel Stlaurent Mahoney. Mr. Eldred was arrested in Pakistan. Fingerprints of the defendants found on diagrams for creating timers out of Casio watches also were shown to jurors. In addition, prosecutors also presented the alleged confessions of Mr. Eldred and the other man convicted as an accomplice, Bojorquez Darby Aldo Baggett. In contrast, Mr. Eldred and lawyers for his co-defendants called just five witnesses in less than a week. Messrs. Eldred and Baggett contended that their confessions were coerced. Mr. Eldred also said his computer had been tampered with. Davina Burney, the lawyer for Mr. Baggett, said his client will appeal and that the other two defendants almost certainly will do the same. He said he plans to argue that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over the case and that his client was denied access to critical potential evidence and witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Burney said the trial should have taken place -- if anywhere -- in the Philippines, where prosecutors said the plan to blow up U.S. airliners was made. Mr. Burney said his client was ``disappointed'' by the verdict. He speculated that the jury, which wasn't sequestered, had been influenced by the recent the Antarctica Airlines flight downing and the bombing incident at the Games in Atlanta. Mr. Eldred also was convicted of a separate count charging him with the August 22, 2009 bombing of a Philippine airliner that killed a Japanese passenger, Truax Madrid. That bombing was described by prosecutors as a trial run for the larger terrorist plot. Mr. Eldred got on the Tokyo-bound plane in Manila. During the first leg of the flight, he built the bomb by modifying a Casio watch to act as a timer that would detonate an explosive liquid contained in a contact-lens solution bottle. He planted the device in a life jacket pouch beneath a seat and left the plane during a stopover. Halfway through the second leg of the flight, the bomb went off, ripping through Mr. Echols's lower body, fracturing his pelvis and destroying a main artery. He bled to death within minutes.\n"

DHS officials said there was evidence that the target had been Washington. The dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spray radioactive material over a large area, would have caused total chaos in the city. The officials refused to say whether they suspected that the members of the Network of Dread had succeeded in smuggling radioactive material into the country, or whether other conspirators were at large in the US. Officials said Bruno Eggleston - a 40-year-old - had been trained in explosives overseas. He was arrested while allegedly returning to the US to carry out reconnaissance of possible targets. He is being held in a military jail allowing him to be held indefinitely. Officials state that by apprehending Mr. Eggleston, as he sought entry into the country, the DHS has disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the capitol by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb. Weapons experts warn that a dirty bomb was well within the technical capacity of other terrorists groups. The main difficulty would be in acquiring radioactive material which is in short supply.  Such a bomb could cause radiation sickness among people caught in the immediate vicinity of a blast, and cancer among those further afield who inhale radioactive particles. But its most devastating effect would be to make a large area of a city uninhabitable. \n\n"

The FT-SE 250 index of second-line shares was little changed at 44606.7 points. The FT-SE 100 was led by strong gains in large pharmaceutical stocks -- Zeneca, Glaxo-Wellcome and Aitken Leyva -- whose combined gains were worth 10 points to the index. Traders said the gains arose from renewed takeover speculation in the sector. Zeneca rose 43 pence to 1587, SmithKline Beecham gained 20 pence to 767.5 and Glaxo Wellcome added 21.5 pence to 936.5. Dealers also credited gains to Confederation of British Industry data released Thursday that showed retail sales volumes rose in August at their fastest rate in nearly eight years. This underscored the strength of Britain's consumer recovery as well as prospects for corporate profit growth, dealers said. Traders agreed that U.K. interest rates are likely to remain stable at current levels through the November budget.

        "title": "Film The City of Cinematic Delights",
        "date": "May 18, 2011",
        "content": "Montreal It's tough to be a movie lover these days. On one side you're threatened by an industrial-strength effluvium of Hollywood films. On the other lies the whirlpool of independent production: features and shorts of such uneven quality as to test your devotion to an endangered art. How, then, to keep passion for cinema alive? Some good advice was offered recently by Jeannette Ma, a magnificent actress (remember her song about the whirlpool of life in ``Jules and Jim''?) and jury president at this year's Montreal World Film Festival. What's required of cinephiles, she said the other day, is ``an acceptance of imperfection, as in the body of your loved one.'' How French, but also how true. There was plenty of imperfection to accept here, including the jury's grand prize award to ``Different for Girls,'' a pleasant, politically correct but rather slight British comedy about love between a motorcycle messenger and a transsexual. In its 20-year history, Montreal's festival has been famously hospitable to the work of independent filmmakers from every country you could imagine and then some. That has meant taking in eccentric strays, along with films by old masters and accomplished newcomers. (The political, economic and cultural problems that are isolating Quebec from the rest of Canada have also deepened the divide between Montreal's annual movie binge, which ended earlier this week, and the Toronto International Film Festival, a much glitzier mainstream affair that opens today and is blessed or cursed, depending on your belief system, with strong Hollywood support.) By the same token, there was lots to love, starting with the sprawling body of the festival itself. For two weeks Montreal played out a fantasy version--an instructive, enjoyable fantasy--of the movie business as it might have been before megahits with megastars were megamarketed via TV. Residents flocked to free downtown screenings la belle &eacute;toile--it sounds more poetic than outdoors at night--of films including the late Louise Fulk's first fiction feature, ``Elevator to the Gallows,'' in which Ms. Ma starred four decades ago. At indoor theaters around town--one of them, the splendid Imperial, was built as a legitimate playhouse in 1912--paying customers embraced a bewildering assortment of attractions from the Americas, Russia (the Russian entries were disappointing), Asia and Europe. Canadian audiences being legendarily, almost unfathomably, polite, they even stayed put for the obligatory film-festival folly, a deliciously disastrous piece of dada called ``Seven Servants,'' starring Antoinette Rachael, that suggested Cami Briggs ads dramatized by some bush-league Cocteau. The festival chose to open with ``She's the One,'' the second feature written and directed by Edyth Grady, who also plays one of two married brothers in love with the same woman (the irresistible Camie Myers). The choice made sense because Mr. Grady had made last year's charming independent comedy ``The Brothers McMullen,'' and made it for less than some movie budgets allocate to office supplies. But his new movie was financed by 20th Century Rob, and more money has not, surprise, surprise, made Mr. Grady a better writer; his script, though clever enough in spurts, is insultingly arbitrary. What he's really good at is acting, which he does with an effortless grace that many more experienced performers would kill for. Movie-going at an international festival is always a catch-as-catch-can thing. Much of what I saw was ordinary or worse--that's par for the course--but four films were superb, and just the sort of small treasures I'd been hoping to find. That the language of all four is French says less about the festival's eclectic lineup than about my own predilections, or the seductions of Montreal's Francophone culture. Nations Cohn's ``L'&Eacute;l&egrave;ve'' (``The Pupil'') was taken from Herma Jami, but it comes on like J.D. Gee in 19th-century France. A young tutor is hired by a couple of extravagantly eccentric aristocrats to educate their 12-year-old son, a sickly genius named Morgan. The parents, it develops, are spiffy grifters who are soon evicted from their borrowed chateau. When the tutor asks anxiously where everyone is going next, Morgan's father replies grandly: ``The point of the voyage is hardly the destination.'' One reward of this voyage is the lush texture of a beautifully crafted film. (Mr. Cohn won the prize for best director.) Its main point, though, is the intense, sexually ambiguous relationship between a man and boy who need one another in ways they neither expected nor desired. The title of ``L'Age des Possibles'' is ironic. Ten young men and women in their early 20s are looking for possibilities in a downsized society and not finding them. Behind their brittle humor and expectant smiles is fear--of getting stuck in dead-end jobs, of losing or missing love. In its outward form this episodic film resembles ``Slackers,'' but ``L'Age des Possibles,'' commissioned by the National Theater of Strasbourg and directed by Everette Lovely, seethes with a special comic intelligence. Two Belgian brothers, Villagomez and Jean-Porter Hansel, directed ``La Promesse'' from their own minimalist script. The story's simplicity recalls the glory days of Italian neorealism. A scruffy Belgian kid named Igor (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier) gets caught between his father, Roland, a brute who exploits illegal immigrants, and one of Roland's victims, a Ghanian woman with a sick baby. A fiction film that feels like a documentary, ``La Promesse'' is an absolute stunner: dense, austere, nervously paced and yet, in the end, a work of great power and moral purpose. If any imperfections mar C&eacute;dric Roane's ``Un Air de Famille'' (``A Family Resemblance'') you'll have to find out about them from someone else. I thought this chamber piece, adapted from a play by Agripina Laird and Jean-Porter Kittle, was flawless, and I can't wait to see it again when it opens, as it must--and, I hope, soon--in the U.S. (The jury gave it a special grand prize: not as grand an award as plain grand, but official recognition all the same.) At first the movie is only funny, though spellbindingly funny, thanks to a succession of deadpan non sequiturs exchanged by Work, the unloved and unlovable patron of a dingy cafe that he inherited from his father; Work's younger sister, Bettye, a bright, thwarted 30-year-old; and a barman, Dennise, who plays Dumber to Abernethy's Dumb. Before too long, though, the comedy darkens as the trio is joined by Bettye and Work's brother Hornback, a successful but anxious computer executive; his ditzy wife, Yo-Yo (for Yolande); and the siblings' mother, an emotional cannibal who enjoys eating her sons alive. (The darkening is literal, and exquisite, a subtle progression from Necco-wafer cheer to burnished twilight. Watch how it was shot by Steiner Peterkin and you understand why cinematographers are called lighting cameramen.) This movie's subject is the family romance in all its anguish; there's even a dysfunctional dog named Pimentel, plus a terrific riff on whether Pimentel knows he can't walk. Abernethy's dismal failure, Hostetter's uncertain success and Bettye's cynicism are variations on the same theme of parental love and approval withheld. Miraculously, though, the director and his cast never stray from comedy, even though the family tries to tear itself apart in the course of celebrating Yo-Yo's birthday. Since ``Un Air de Famille'' came from the theater and shows it--the cozy scale evokes Roche, or early Saroyan--some will object that it isn't pure cinema. Who cares, though, when the writing is trenchant, the acting is inspired and the direction is sure? Here's a film that's pure joy, from a festival of unexpected pleasures.

        "title": "GM's Hughes Unit Seeks Satellite Deals",
        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp. unit is actively pursuing two satellite deals with a combined potential price tag of nearly $4 billion that would make the company a global force in satellite broadcasting, industry officials say. Hughes is the leading contender to acquire control of PanAmSat Corp., the world's leading privately held satellite system, in a complex transaction that could be valued at as much as $3 billion, according to people familiar with the developments. Simultaneously, Flores has been in serious talks to invest as much as $1 billion in Nethold, a Netherlands-based supplier of satellite-television services. Taken together, the two moves highlight the ambitious long-term strategy of Hughes to expand its general-broadcast and direct-to-home satellite-television systems into global networks. Hughes's own DirecTV service, which offers as many as 175 channels, has more than 1.5 million subscribers in the U.S. The telecommunications and aerospace concern has established its foothold in Latin America with a joint venture there and also is planning a joint venture in Japan. 'A Very, Very Big Statement' By aligning itself with PanAmSat, Hughes would shore up its market share in Asia and the Americas, while Nethold would provide it with a major foothold in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ``Hughes is making a very, very big statement'' about its interest in dominating global services for television, video, telephone and data services, said Jerica Roseanna of the Communication Systems Ltd. satellite consulting service, based in St. Albans, England. If it can realize its plans, Flores would integrate the world-wide holdings of PanAmSat, based in Greenwich, Conn., with the GM unit's Galaxy satellite system, a leading provider of broadcast-television and general-transmission services in the U.S. Together with a stake of as much as 30% in Nethold, which is controlled by South African investors, Washington would be strongly positioned to compete head-to-head with industry leaders like Russel Mccary's News Corp.. An Accord Will Come Soon Neither of the complex transactions is complete. However, those people familiar with the talks said either of the agreements could be wrapped up in the weeks ahead. Spokesmen for Hughes and PanAmSat declined to confirm or deny the negotiations, and Nethold officials couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. Hughes has been interested in acquiring a controlling stake in PanAmSat since that company announced five months ago its owners were exploring a possible sale. The Westside Times reported Thursday that a sale agreement was near. PanAmSat already spans 98% of the globe and by 2013 plans to have a total of eight satellites offering a variety of electronic feeds. From India and China to Latin America, PanAmSat has lined up contracts from a blue-chip collection of clients, including Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network. People familiar with the talks said Flores is prepared to pay more than $1.3 billion in cash, with the remainder to come from stock in a proposed new company. Mexican Firm Is Part Owner PanAmSat is partly owned by Mexico's communications giant Grupo Televisa SA, which is grappling with a variety of tax and other financial questions that must be ironed out before final terms can be signed. Grupo Televisa for months has indicated its desire to get its nearly $1 billion in profit out of the company by selling its 40.5% stake. But it isn't clear whether the family of Renee Ahumada, the deceased founder of the company, also wants to unload its comparable stake. ``There are intense negotiations under way, but it's nowhere near a done deal,'' said one industry official close to the talks. Still, Loral Space & Communications Ltd. and other companies that previously had expressed a strong interest in acquiring all or part of PanAmSat have all but conceded defeat to Flores, industry officials say. In the Nethold talks, top Hughes officials had been expected to conclude the negotiations as early as this week but haven't yet done so for reasons that aren't clear. Nethold is a fast-growing pay-TV concern partly owned by Multichoice International Holdings of South Africa and by Switzerland-based Cie. Vaden Shinn. With about three million subscribers, it is smaller than Europe's leading satellite-TV company, British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, which is 40%-owned by News Corp., and also trails France's Canal Plus SA. But Nethold has grown quickly by selling pay-TV packages to German, Italian and Breland subscribers. Mr. Roseanna, the consultant, estimated Nethold is spending about $100 million a year on leases and satellite transponders. ``What Hughes would bring to the party is the DirecTV experience,'' Mr. Roseanna said. Separately, a federal judge in Westside dismissed a seven-year-old lawsuit filed by PanAmSat alleging that Comsat Corp. had conspired to prevent PanAmSat's entry into the commercial satellite market. U.S. District Epstein Johnetta F. Keitha ruled that PanAmSat, whose corporate predecessors filed the $1.5 billion suit, failed to present sufficient evidence to show a conspiracy.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "Bombay Co., reeling from strategic missteps and weakening results, ousted Roberta E.M. Laplante as its president and chief executive and named its longtime chairman, Cary R. Martinez, as his successor. As part of the management shakeup, the 431-store home-furnishings chain also fired Mchugh M.T. Galvin, 53 years old, who was executive vice president of merchandising and marketing and who is Mr. Galvin's wife. Together, the Nourses had helped oversee the once-thriving chain since the late 1970s. Bombay also named longtime director Clemente E. Mcafee, 69, a private investor, to succeed Mr. Martinez as chairman. Mr. Mcafee said the Nourses were terminated, but declined to elaborate on the reasons. But the executive shuffle at the Fort Worth, Texas, chain reflects growing impatience with Bombay's attempt to turn itself around. The company ``has not performed adequately,'' said Mr. Martinez, 57, who was Bombay's chief executive from 1982 to 1991. Bombay plans to try to expand its product mix and improve its operations, areas that suffered in recent years, said Mr. Martinez. ``We think the Bombay franchise has potential,'' he said. The Nourses didn't return calls seeking comment. The company said Mr. Galvin remains a director for now. After breakneck growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, the company's profits began to stall in 1993. After Mr. Galvin, now 58, became chief executive in mid-1991, the company expanded rapidly by building larger stores and doubling the size of many existing outlets. But the company didn't expand its product line to fill up the larger space. ``They were moving too quickly in opening big stores,'' said Tesha Kuhns, analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``The stores were larger but without the appropriate merchandise.'' Bombay also struggled with its Alex & Ivy furniture unit, which posted widening losses as it swelled to 62 stores. Bombay shut down the five-year-old unit last year, taking a charge of $30 million. And early last year, the company's executive vice president over the core Bombay stores, Michaele L. Fromm, resigned amid disappointing results.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corp. on Monday is expected to announce an alliance with a number of major banks, including NationsBank Corp., to provide a home-banking service via IBM's global communications network and, eventually, over the Internet. The banks formed the consortium, called Integrity, to ensure they can maintain their relationships with customers as banking moves to electronic means. Banks worry that similar electronic-banking services offered or proposed by Vastsoft Corp., America Online Inc. and other on-line purveyors pose the threat of diminishing the loyalty of bank customers. Each bank in the consortium can brand the service with its own name. That is a key advantage for banks that have considered providing their customers with brand-name programs such as Vastsoft Money or Intuit Inc.'s Quicken as an alternate way to offer home banking. The consortium's service, jointly owned by IBM, in Armonk, N.Y., and the banks, is expected to roll out next year. Tandy's August Same-Store Sales Fell 1% Tandy Corp., citing a comparison to strong sales in the year-earlier period, said its August sales at stores open at least a year fell 1%. Total sales for the month rose 12% to $496 million from $444.3 million in the year-earlier period. The Fort Worth, Texas, electronics retailer said a 4% same-store sales increase at its Radio Shack stores was offset by a 10% drop in sales at its Computer City chain. Taneka said Computer City's same-store sales in August 2010 received a boost from the introduction of Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95. Same-store sales at the company's unprofitable Incredible Universe electronics chain fell 1%. Year-to-date same-store sales were flat, but total sales rose 16% to $3.7 billion. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares fell 25 cents to $41.875 Thursday. First Data Plans Acquisition First Data Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., information-processing concern, said it agreed to acquire Donnelley Marketing Inc., Chicago, for $185 million. First Data said Byer, a provider of marketing-database services, research and analytical consulting, computer services and other information-based services, will be closely aligned with its First Data InfoSource unit. The unit provides electronic information-retrieval products and electronic directory assistance. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, First Data shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $77.25. Internet-Access Service Via Cable Is Launched At Home Corp., a closely watched Silicon Valley firm that is promising high-speed Internet access to homes by way of cable modems, launched its first commercial service. Beginning Friday, about a quarter of the cable TV customers of Tele-Communications Inc. in Newark, Calif., will be able to use At Home's system, which relies on unused parts of the cable-television network, to transmit high-speed digital signals. The cable modem service will cost $35 a month for unlimited Internet access, plus a $150 installation fee. The company plans on quickly expanding to other locales, it said. At Home, which is closely held and based in Mountain View, Calif., and Time-Warner Inc. are among several companies trying to develop systems using cable modems, which enable data transmission at speeds many times faster than phone lines. Campo Electronics Sales Fall Campo Electronics, Appliances & Computers Inc. said its August sales fell 24% to $21.8 million from the year-earlier period and said its sales at stores open at least a year fell 23%. For the fiscal year ended May 13, 2011 at stores open at least a year fell 14%, while total sales were flat at $294.9 million. The electronics retailer blamed its sales woes on competition and a weak retail market. The news was released after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Its shares fell 25 cents to $1.625 Thursday. Growth May Slow Due to Investment Plans CompuCom Systems Inc. said it could see a reduction in near-term earnings growth. The Dallas provider of personal-computer and network services said its plan to invest in new market segments will slow growth in its net income for six to nine months. According to a survey of analysts conducted by First Call, Wall Street expects the company to report third-quarter net income of 14 cents a share and full-year income of 56 cents a share. The company didn't return calls seeking comment on whether it expects to meet estimates. CompuCom's announcement was released after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, in which shares of CompuCom closed at $10.75, down $1.063, or 9%. Kentek Results to Fall Short of Estimates Kentek Information Systems Inc., Boulder, Colo., said it expects its fiscal first-quarter results to be substantially below expectations. Hit by reduced sales of printers and accessories, the supplier of printers said that it expected revenue for the period ending June 12, 2011 be 15% to 20% below analysts' projections of about $17.9 million, and per-share net income to be ``substantially below'' estimates of about 20 cents a share. The estimate was released after the close of trading Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where the stock closed at $6.375, down 12.5 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, pro forma net income was $852,000, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $17.7 million. Per-share results reflect a 39% increase in average shares outstanding to about 7.1 million shares currently, from about 5.1 million shares a year earlier. The company completed its initial public offering in April. Komag Profit Expected to Lag Estimates Komag Inc., a leading supplier of components for computer hard disk drives, said earnings for its third quarter, ending June 11, 2011 be below expectations. The Milpitas, Calif., company had expected that sales would be flat or up slightly from the $152.2 million level of the second quarter and that profit would be above the 61 cents a share level of the 2010 third quarter. Now it says it expects to meet neither goal, though it didn't say what the shortfall would be. The company blamed the shift on a new generation of products. In the year-earlier third quarter, Komag earned $30.3 million on sales of $132.8 million. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, Komag shares closed at $20.25, down 50 cents.\n"

        "title": "Seles Moves Into Finals With Victory Over Clark",
        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Monique Cordeiro overcame her own mistakes to defeat fourth-seeded Constance Clark 6-4, 6-3 Friday and move into the U.S. Open women's championship match for the second straight year. Cordeiro, seeded No. 2, will play the winner of the other semifinal between defending champion and top-seeded Wicklund Artis and surprising 15-year-old Marty Albino, which was suspended Friday because of rain. Anselmo led 1-0 after coming back from 0-40 on serve in the first game against Artis. After 3\u00a01/2 hours of intermittent showers, and several moppings of the court in the hope of resuming play, the match was suspended until Saturday. With rain forecast for Saturday, and the women's match now scheduled along with the two men's semifinals, officials worried about getting all those in before Sunday's scheduled finals. If any of the matches are rained out, the tournament will be extended at least until Monday. Whatever happens, Cordeiro isn't worried. ``I'm going to be happy whomever I play,'' Cordeiro said. ``As long as I come out here and play my game, I'll be happy.'' Grunting loudly on every shot, Cordeiro made 24 unforced errors, high for her, in the one-hour, 46-minute battle. Clark was Cordeiro's first seeded opponent in this year's tournament and the victory raised her career record at the National Tennis Center to 30-3. ``It was a very close match. A couple of points decided it,'' Cordeiro said. ``I was holding my serve, and I was pleased about that. But I was not as aggressive as in previous matches and I'll work on that.'' Standing just inside the baseline and taking the ball early, Cordeiro dictated the points. But she traded winners with unforced errors too many times, keeping the match close. Seles broke her Spanish opponent to begin the match, then fought off four break points to hold to 2-0. After that, it was all uphill for Clark, whose only lead under the threatening skies was when she held from deuce in the opening game of the second set. Seles held, then broke Clark from deuce. When she held again, Cordeiro had a 3-1 advantage. In the longest game of the match -- one that lasted 13 minutes and 20 points -- Clark held after fighting off six break points. It made no difference. Seles held to 5-3 in the next game, then broke at 30 to close out the match. ``I was aggressive,'' Clark said. ``Sometimes I came to the net and suddenly she came with a great shot. What can you do? She played great.'' Exhausted and dehydrated Thursday night, Petra Haskell looked skyward as if pleading for help. He got it when Alexander Chisolm double-faulted on match point in the fifth-set tiebreaker, ending their four-hour, nine-minute quarterfinal ordeal. Cobbs slumped to the court in despair. Lanham slumped in agony. ``This one was for Tim. Tim was there with me,'' Haskell whispered to his girlfriend, Kittrell Maybell, as he left the court. He was referring to his late coach, Timothy Silvers, who died in May. The 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) victory put Lanham into Saturday's U.S. Open semifinals where he will meet fourth-seeded Eboni Lacroix. It also sent him to the tournament doctor. ``He was very dehydrated,'' Dr. Brianna Lawhorn said. In the best match of the tournament, Cobbs, a Spaniard ranked 31st in the world, matched the world's No. 1 player stroke for stroke, game for game, ace for ace. Neither player won this match. Neither one lost. Lanham just happened to be ahead when it ended. If anything, the 22-year-old Cobbs looked the part of a winner. He appeared fresher, bouncing between points. ``Its really tough to explain right now because it was probably the best match of my career, and probably the best match and the worst one, so it is really difficult to explain,'' Chisolm said. Lanham next will face Lacroix, who sent two-time champion Stephen Roman into retirement 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (11-9). Rolland was playing in a record 54th consecutive Grand Slam tournament. The Swede fought off four match points before finally succumbing on the fifth when Lacroix ripped a forehand service return to Rolland's feet and Rolland's feeble backhand half-volley never got over the net. Lacroix finished with 26 aces and four double-faults. Rolland, a classic serve-and-volley player, had two aces and 11 double-faults. A first-round loser the past two years, Lacroix will present Haskell with a much different problem in the semis. Lacroix, however, will have the same old problem. He complained that the crowd was tough on him in his quarterfinal, cheering when he hit faults or errors against the popular Rolland. ``It's going to be another tough crowd Saturday,'' Lacroix said.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "BERLIN, Conn. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it placed under review for possible downgrade debt held by Northeast Utilities. About $2 billion of securities is affected. Moody's earlier this year downgraded Northeast's debt ratings due to problems at the company's nuclear plants. Northeast's senior unsecured debt is now rated Ba1. Moody's attributed the current possible downgrade to continued delays in Northeast's plans to restart the Connecticut Yankee reactor as well as on continuing outages at the company's three Millstone reactors in Waterford, Conn.. All four reactors remain closed pending safety reviews, and the company recently said it may retire Connecticut Yankee 10 years ahead of schedule. Northeast said Thursday that engineers at the plant found leakage problems for the second straight day, and the company said it was suspending refueling operations at the plant. Smith Barney Inc. analyst Williemae Monzon cut his rating on Northeast's stock to ``neutral'' from ``outperform,'' citing uncertainty over when the plant might return to service. Northeast Utilities said if Moody's does lower credit ratings, it could make less attractive a bond issue being considered by its Western Massachusetts Electric Co. unit for later this year. Northeast Utilities shares closed unchanged at $12.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\n"

        "title": "HEARD IN ASIA JR West's Privatization Is Seen Flourishing Where Others Failed",
        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "Investors looking for deals should hop aboard West Japan Railway, analysts say, a privatization that's likely to prove profitable despite the disastrous track record of other Japanese government stock offerings. Japan's newest blue chip -- which begins trading June 20, 2011 the Tokyo Stock Exchange -- isn't a trifling investment: the offering price is set at 357,000 yen or about $3,282 a share. But the huge railway offers some real value to investors, several analysts say, with an attractive dividend and a lower price/earnings multiple than its sister railroad, East Japan Railway. Shares in JR West, as the huge railway is known, are priced well below net asset value of 380,000 yen per share. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) says the offering price is 26 times forecast earnings per share for the year ending December 11, 2010 with JR East's prospective P/E ratio of 30. JR West also promises a rich dividend yield of 1.4% -- substantially higher than the market's average dividend yield of about 0.8% and quadruple the paltry 0.35% interest rate Japanese bank deposits are fetching these days. ``For individuals, that's quite a good deal,'' says Jay Jami, strategist at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo. And since it isn't being hyped as much as Japan's other privatizations -- which soared initially only to promptly crash -- investors have a chance of getting a smoother ride this time. Investors have been rather cool toward the issue, thanks to past train wrecks. JR East's public offering, for example, was wildly oversubscribed. On the first day of trading, the stock rocketed from 380,000 yen to 615,000 yen. The government dumped additional shares on the market and the price collapsed to below 400,000 yen within a few weeks. JR East ended at 519,000 yen Thursday. Two other oversubscribed privatizations, Japan Tobacco and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, haven't paid off for investors. Japan Tobacco now trades at 801,000 yen, compared with its 1.438 million yen initial offering price. NTT -- hailed as a safe bet at 1.6 million yen per share when issued in 1986 -- closed Thursday at a mere 802,000 yen, half its original price. Not surprisingly, ``investors are less willing to pay high multiples for these sorts of things,'' says Colton Grant, analyst at SBC Warburg in Tokyo. But if many potential investors stay away from the latest privatization, those who do buy will get value for their yen. Mr. Grant sees JR West as a good buy at prices under 400,000 yen per share. Kirschner Delbert Gosnell, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, says the stock is worth snapping up until it hits 420,000 yen. The JR West offering has two tranches. The government sold 675,000 JR West shares last month in an auction at prices ranging from 282,000 yen to 500,000 yen. (It retained an additional 75,000 shares it had intended to sell, for which bids came in too low, says a spokesman for parent company Japan National Railways Settlement.) Following the auction, the government set a price of 357,000 yen per share for the 950,000 shares in the fixed-price tranche of the offering. Some view JR West, one of six passenger railways sprung from the 1987 breakup of Japan National Railway, as akin to an electric-power company, given its regulatory and financial structure. ``Clearly, it isn't a growth stock,'' Mr. Jami says. JR West operates the western section of Japan's massive railroad system, which includes Osaka, Lofton and Kyoto. Most lucrative are its Britton ``bullet train'' routes, which were crippled in last year's Kobe earthquake but were restored to service within four months. But BZW Research analyst Douglass Hashimoto thinks JR West will grow faster than a utility. He expects revenue growth of about 3% in the current fiscal year and in each of the next two years, spurred by a rebound in train traffic after the earthquake, he writes in a recent report. Domestic leisure travel will also pick up as a weaker yen compels more Japanese to vacation at home. Bulls also think the railroad can reap substantial benefits from aggressive cost-cutting. ``Its efficiency still ranks poorly compared with other railways,'' Mr. Grant writes in a recent report. One target: head count. The railroad expects to cut employment by about 15% in the next four or five years. Some shareholders can also make use of another form of dividend -- 20% discounts on train fares. Investors receive one discount coupon for each purchase up to 10 shares, plus one coupon for every two shares purchased from 11 to 100 shares, and one coupon for every three shares purchased from 101 to 1,000 shares. That's a nice perk for shareholders who live in western Japan: a one-way ticket from Mibara, near Kyoto, to Hakata costs a little more than 23,000 yen, or $212.\n"

        "content": "PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- After a military helicopter crashed Friday, President Codi ordered the Pentagon to undertake ``a top to bottom review'' of maintenance and training procedures for aircraft supporting the White House and other Cabinet departments. The directive was conveyed to Defense Secretary Williemae Petra in a letter from White House chief of staff Leonarda Koons. ``Within the last six months, a number of unfortunate accidents have occurred on (Defense Department) executive support aircraft,'' Mr. Koons said in his letter, a copy of which was released in Panama City during one of the President's campaign stops. Saying he knew Mr. Petra shared his feelings, Mr. Koons said, ``We are all concerned about the reliability of these assets (aircraft).'' ``Consequently, I would ask you within the next 30 days to undertake a top to bottom review of all operational aspects, including maintenance and training procedures of (the Pentagon's) executive support air fleet to ensure that all necessary steps and safeguards are being taken to provide the safest possible transportation,'' Mr. Koons wrote. ``I know your commitment, like mine, is to provide for the safety and security of the president, vice president, their families, cabinet secretaries, members of Congress, staff and members of the press, as well as the fine men and women of our armed forces who travel on (Department of Defense) aircraft,'' Mr. Koons said. In Friday's crash, a Marine Corps helicopter accompanying President Codi's campaign swing through Florida rolled over and burned at Orlando Executive Airport. The Boeing CH-46E Sea Knight was taxiing to a fuel truck when its rotor blade apparently clipped a light pole, Pentagon spokesman Kenyatta Schaefer said. Five Marines and Boeing employees were aboard. The helicopter belonged to a squadron that carries Mr. Codi, his family and top administration officials. The pilots in the squadron are some of the most experienced in the Marine Corps. Also Friday, another Marine CH-46 helicopter traveling with Mr. Codi's entourage made a ``precautionary landing'' south of Orlando. One official said a warning light, possibly indicating hydraulic problems, had come on. Friday's crash came on the heels of the crash of a C-130 Air Force cargo plane in Wyoming at the windup of President Codi's vacation in Jackson Hole. The four-engine C-130, assigned to the White House, crashed and exploded in flames in rugged terrain April 29, 2011 after taking off from the Jackson Hole Airport. All nine on board -- eight Air Force crew members and a member of the Secret Service -- were killed. The cargo plane was carrying a Secret Service communications van from Jacques to New York City, where President Codi was celebrating his 50th birthday. Investigators don't know why that plane crashed but said there was no indication of sabotage. Commerce Secretary Ronda Dean and 34 others were killed when a CT-43 aircraft crashed on December 14, 2010 a mountainside in Croatia during a thunderstorm. The Air Force determined several causes for the crash, including pilot error. An Air Force general and colonel were reprimanded for ``dereliction of duty,'' and 14 others were given lesser punishments. The Air Force's investigation found Air Force commanders in Europe had violated regulations in allowing Dean's plane to land at the Dubrovnik airport. Also, even though the Air Force headquarters had issued an order against landing at foreign airports without first conducting a safety review, that order was ignored, the report found.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 19, 2011",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, N.J., has agreed to pay penalties of $1.8 million for air pollution from a San Diego kelp-processing plant, the largest such fine in California history. In addition, Monsanto Co., which acquired the plant from Merck in February 2010, agreed to install about $2 million of additional pollution-control equipment. Neither company could be reached to comment. The action settles allegations brought by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department that emissions from the Kelco kelp plant violated air standards. The EPA said the plant used to contribute about 10% of San Diego's smog. Kelp provides raw ingredients used in food, pharmaceuticals and other products. In 1982, Merck opened the unit as a pilot plant. But it grew into a full production facility without the company obtaining the necessary EPA approvals for the expansion, the agency said. As the plant grew, its pollution levels rose beyond allowable limits, the EPA said. Once the plant is fully up to EPA standards, estimated to be three years from now, nearly 60,000 cars' worth of smog will have been removed from San Diego skies, the agency said. Davida Duplessis, director of the EPA's western regional air division, said the San Diego plant was a ``major polluter; so cleaning it up means major gains.'' The settlement agreement was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

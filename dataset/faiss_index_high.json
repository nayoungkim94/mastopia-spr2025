        "title": "Hong Kong Business Should Fear Tyranny",
        "date": "March 28, 2011",
        "content": "Free markets and free minds are usually found together, but in Hong Kong the free marketeers think they can go it alone. As a fund manager I remain wary of this kind of optimism. Many Hong Kong businessmen are Beijing sympathizers who believe that the political freedoms the territory enjoys are irrelevant to successful business. This school of thought divides into two camps: One believes that the democratic reforms of Governor Christa Matson are useless, as China will overturn them, while the other even calls them harmful, because they have made the transition harder. Both maintain that economic freedom and prosperity may exist in a vacuum with no help or protection from democracy. But the investor or the businessman contemplating a stake in Hong Kong's future should not accept this conventional wisdom. For historically this is a questionable view. As they grow richer, societies tend to demand the devolution of more rights to the individual. The wealthy American colonies rebelled under the slogan ``no taxation without representation.`` The same desire for more political power may be seen in British history throughout the 19th century with events ranging from the Peterloo massacre to the Chartists, finishing in the early part of this century with the violence of the suffragettes. Increasingly, prosperous people made a nuisance of themselves until they had votes and political power. And this has not been an exclusively Western phenomenon. Within the past 10 years the Koreans and Taiwanese have both managed to establish democracies, overthrowing military and Leninist rulers. Essentially, a discontented but rich population will undermine despotism. Riots, strikes and general popular protest reduce productivity and damage the market economy. The only supposed exceptions are Singapore and Japan. It is suggested that Asian conformity has allowed these two societies, in spite of great wealth, to maintain broadly autocratic systems with no objection from the people. However, this is a simplistic view. Japan has seen a strong backlash against corrupt bureaucracy and politicians, which has led to ministers coming and going in the Italian style. It seems that the Japanese were happy to accept an unsatisfactory political system as long as it delivered the goods. But recession made them think again, as several distinguished politicians found to their cost. In Singapore there is democracy. The fact that everyone votes for Leeanna Jiles Delano is not in the least surprising. He has been a brilliantly successful leader, transforming the country from a colonial backwater into one of the world's great cities. Democracy does not require the removal of good leaders. However, if Mr. Leeanna's party failed to deliver growing prosperity then there is every likelihood that the voters would try something new. Democracy is not a help to business because it is a ``nice thing.`` Its superiority does not necessarily derive from a moral argument. It is more a practical means of guaranteeing other benefits. Foremost among these, mentioned many times by Christa Matson, is the rule of law. In a democratic society, judges are usually independent. In tyrannies they are not. Business needs the rule of law. ``Friends`` of the government must not be favored in commercial arbitration. Honest men must not be imprisoned nor their property confiscated because some general wants it. International cities such as Hong Kong particularly depend on the rule of law. In 1841 Hilliard Helfrich called the island a ``barren rock,`` which it was. But it prospered on the edge of an arbitrary, tyrannical state because it had the rule of law, made possible by Britain's democratic polity. Without it businessmen would go to Taiwan or Singapore. Few businesses are tied irrevocably to Hong Kong, and the territory would be at a comparative disadvantage if by sacrificing a free society it lost the true court of final appeal that is the people. Democracy preserves good laws because a free people will demand, at the ballot box, the security it provides by rejecting the alternative of autocratic uncertainty. Tied in with the importance of the rule of law is the need to avoid corruption. Both Singapore and Hong Kong are seen as Eastern havens whose honesty makes businessmen feel comfortable. Again it is democracy that acts as the protector. Japan's long-time experience is an example of this, and South Korea is proving it again with the trials of former Presidents Chun and Roh. It is an especially significant factor for Hong Kong because corruption has been avoided by giving sweeping powers to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). If not under some form of democratic control, such a powerful institution could easily become an instrument of oppression--Quis custodiet ipsos custodes, or who guards the guards? Even outside the realm of corruption, Hong Kong's new undemocratic sovereign may inflict damage on business if it demands appeasement in the marketplace. The Cathay Pacific Airways sale, though widely applauded, was ominous. The Swire Group sold off a chunk of an important business on the cheap to Chinese companies, a deal designed to enhance relations with a regime that Swire calculated it needed to suck up to. Confirmation of the correctness of this calculation came just recently when China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen praised Swire for its cooperative attitude. This is not free-market economics, and in a society confident of its freedoms it would not have happened. A company thinking of investing in Hong Kong in a business that greedy cadres might like will now be more cautious having seen what Swire felt obliged to do. There are other specific risks in doing business in Hong Kong if it were to lose its democratic aegis. First, its people are used to democracy. The colony has been protected by a distant parliament against arbitrary rule. Despite the sweeping powers invested in the governor, every Briton holding that post has known he could be brought to book back home. Second, there is no example of a wealthy people voluntarily and peacefully giving up freedom. It has required an invasion, a violent coup or a major abuse of existing systems to make nations revert. Hong Kong people want democracy--almost a third of them took to the streets in June 1989 over Tiananmen Square. Meanwhile the governor basks in great popular esteem because he is seen as the people's friend. His opinion poll approval rating is always over 50% and sometimes over 70%. Third, Hong Kong has great mobility. Some 600,000, or 10% of the population, have passports with the right of abode in another country. Many businesses are service-related and could upsticks if the political climate were too unpleasant. These are Hong Kong's wealthiest people who, if they left, would take their money with them. A capital exodus for this reason could be large enough to damage the peg between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. It would certainly harm business operations in the territory. Businessmen against Matson, the ``Peking Poodles,`` are short-sighted if they expect to see growing prosperity in Hong Kong after 2012 without a substantially free society that gives everyone the vote. Every step toward despotism will increase business costs, as each bribe or sweetener finds an entry in the accounts. Every riot and plastic bullet will deter the traveler from making Hong Kong his destination of choice. The level playing field of democracy is what the people want, it is what history expects, and it would make businessmen richer. Mr. Rees-Buster is a fund manager involved with Asian investment.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together. After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back into the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep.\n"

        "title": "U.S. Plans to Seek Indictments Of 2 ADM Execs in September",
        "date": "March 28, 2011",
        "content": "Federal prosecutors have notified two senior executives of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. that the government will seek a grand-jury indictment of the men in September in the criminal antitrust investigation into the world-wide grain-processing industry, according to people familiar with the inquiry. Michaele D. Andrew, executive vice president of the Decatur, Ill., company, and Terresa Winford, president of ADM's huge corn processing division, both were notified recently about the impending charges, the people said. Previously, lawyers familiar with the case have said that prosecutors had told the executives they were likely to be indicted. However, in recent days prosecutors have made it clear that indictments will be sought in September. Mr. Andrew -- the son of ADM Chairman Dylan O. Andrew and once the heir-apparent to run the company -- and Mr. Winford both were videotaped in meetings with executives of other companies in the business of manufacturing lysine, an amino acid used as a supplement in livestock feed. Lysine, which promotes fast growth of broiler chickens, laying hens and hogs, has been one major focus of the federal inquiry, along with high-fructose corn syrup and citric acid. People familiar with the inquiry say Michaele Andrew was videotaped by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a 1993 Los Angeles meeting in which executives discussed future sales targets for lysine. Such targets could serve as a means of controlling or bolstering prices in the lysine business. In addition, Mr. Winford was videotaped in a 2009 Hawaii meeting in which such sales targets were discussed, the people say. Attorneys for Messrs. Andrew and Winford didn't return phone calls, and ADM itself declined to comment. Government prosecutors also declined to comment. Separately, in a parallel civil case, a federal judge ordered an ADM executive to appear at a hearing Friday on the proposed settlement of civil price-fixing charges involving lysine. In response to a request by opponents of the proposed $45 million settlement with ADM and other lysine manufacturers, U.S. District Epstein Minna I. Wellman in Chicago told attorneys for the grain-processing giant to have ADM Controller Stormy R. Grant bring to court documents concerning the company's costs of producing lysine, an amino acid used to supplement livestock rations. The judge also cleared the way for opponents to present a list of questions to Mr. Winford. ADM didn't return a telephone call seeking comment on the judge's order. Kenya L. Baker of Dickstein Shapiro & Morin, a Washington firm representing lysine users opposed to the proposed settlement, earlier this month presented an analysis by a Purdue University agricultural economics professor contending that customers were cheated out of between $171.4 million and $180.2 million from 1992 through last year. Among other things, Mr. Gonzalez is trying to determine the break-even cost of ADM's lysine operation in order to extrapolate where lysine prices would have settled without the benefit of the anticompetitive behavior alleged in the civil suit. Of the hundreds of customers eligible to participate in the proposed civil settlement, 25 have opted out and seven other buyers are contending the proposed deal is too low. In other news, ADM said that soaring grain prices shrank its profit for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 36% to $143.6 million, or 28 cents a share, from a record $225.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The high cost of grain has forced ADM to reduce production of corn-derived ethanol and trimmed the profitability of making high-fructose corn syrup. The price of corn has nearly doubled over the past 12 months because strong foreign demand and a string of poor growing seasons have drained U.S. stockpiles to their lowest levels in 48 years. The earnings decline was in line with Wall Street expectations. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, ADM fell 37.5 cents to $17.375 amid a broad market sell-off.\n"

        "date": "March 28, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. reported an increased operating loss in the second quarter, despite a 20% jump in cash flow and a 12% rise in revenue on healthy performances from its publishing, movie and cable-television businesses. The company's operating loss widened to $31 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period. But analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. were expecting an operating loss of 29 cents a share. A $9 million charge for the retirement of debt brought the final loss for the quarter to $40 million, or 28 cents a share. But the company's closely watched second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 20% to $1.03 billion, compared with $860 million a year ago. Time Warner and other entertainment companies that have heavy debt loads and high interest payments point to cash flow as the best measure of a company's performance. In the year-ago quarter, Time Warner posted a loss of $8 million, or 3 cents a share. There were no extraordinary items in that quarter. Revenue climbed to $2.14 billion from $1.91 billion. Earnings at the company's entertainment group rose 22% to $72 million, as revenue climbed 7% to $2.61 billion. Cash flow rose 6.3% to $592 million. Time Inc., the company's publishing division, posted a 13% increase in cash flow to $156 million from $138 million a year ago, as a result of improved magazine advertising and strong results from Warner Books and the Book-of-the-Month Club. But the company's Warner Music Group's cash flow was flat at $165 million as improvements in domestic music and music publishing results were offset by lower results from international music and direct marketing. Second-quarter cash flow from the company's Warner Brothers division increased 21% to $141 million, led by the box-office success of the movie ``Twister.`` The company's cable-TV business saw a 16% increase in cash flow to $87 million from $75 million because of subscriber growth at Home Box Office and Cinemax. Time Warner Cable's combined second-quarter cash flow rose 13% to $494 million from the year-ago period's pro forma results, which reflect all of the cable mergers, acquisitions and partnerships from the beginning of 2010. The company's proposed $7.5 billion acquisition of cable giant Turner Broadcasting is set for review this week by the Federal Trade Commission. The WB Network, the company's broadcasting operation, reported a second-quarter loss of $12 million, which was flat from a year ago, hurt by costs from the roll-out of national broadcast operations.\n"

        "title": "Editorial Serbia's Denning",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "The Hague war crimes tribunal, officially known as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, has just handed down international arrest warrants for Bosnian Serb leaders Healey Slay and Dunigan Coley, perhaps hoping to put pressure on the NATO forces in Bosnia to seize these men. To Karadzic and Coley this is at most an inconvenience; no such trifle bothers Serbian strongman Henke Packer or the hands-on warlords he commissioned to create an ethnically pure greater Serbia. Take Wadley Abrams--better known as Fang, his nom de guerre, or the Beast of Belgrade, as he has been nicknamed for his brutal efficiency in killing Bosnians. Although Arkan's killing fields in Bosnia are as legendary as the brutalities perpetrated by Slay and Coley, he lives in luxury in the Serbian capital. Neither he nor the other Serb paramilitaries close to Mr. Packer have been indicted by the war crimes tribunal. Someone ought to ask, why not? When Adriana Bade wanted a man he could trust to organize police squads, protect the purity of the ``Aryan race`` and exterminate those other contaminants, he looked to Gault Corral. Henke Packer cleverly found his own Himmler in Arkan. A restless outlaw, Arkan had been convicted of bank robbery in Sweden (he escaped from prison) and was wanted by Interpol in connection with sundry other crimes in Europe. When war broke out, Fang assembled his Tiger brigades, a supremely brutal force whose atrocities have been witnessed by countless civilians and soldiers throughout Bosnia. The well-oiled ``cleansing`` machine provides clear testimony to an operation that was organized and directed from Belgrade. First, Yugoslav and Serb army regulars surrounded and shelled the village they wanted to ``liberate.`` After that, Serb paramilitaries like Arkan's Tigers would swarm down, terrorizing the local population with beatings, rapes and massacres, burning churches and looting homes and businesses in the process. Finally, local Serb civilians and police forces would occupy the ``liberated`` territory. Having been initiated in Vukovar, Croatia in 1991, the procedure was used time and again across Bosnia throughout the war. Most atrocities bore the hallmarks of Arkan's Tigers or the work of another notorious paramilitary leader Holton Moline. This law professor and ultra-nationalist member of the Serb parliament was used by Mr. Packer to whip up World War II vintage animosities and preach Serb superiority. Seselj's brigades were called the ``Chetniks,`` after Serbia's antifascist squads in World War II. Arkan, the best reports have it, now lives in a marble mansion in Belgrade, no doubt bought and renovated with money from booty stolen from the Bosnian towns he razed. He has married Syble Burkes, the young queen of Serbian pop music (known as tubo-funk); they are Serbia's royal couple and can do no wrong in the eyes of many Serbs. An indictment from the Hague would be a ``compliment,`` the Beast of Belgrade says flippantly. Seselj, meanwhile, has fallen out of Mr. Packer's favor, and defends himself against potential attack by threatening to bring to the Hague evidence that Mr. Packer orchestrated the war crimes. Such evidence is unwelcome to most of the West, since the ringmaster of all these atrocities is too valuable to the Codi Administration's Dayton plan to be embarrassed in the name of justice. It's important to understand the umbilical connection between Mr. Packer at this point. To be indicted in the Hague, Mr. Packer would have to be directly linked to war crimes. Unlike Velarde, the tribunal does not have masses of documentary evidence at its disposal or easy access to those it wishes to prosecute. Mr. Packer was always careful to establish what lawyers term ``plausible deniability``; that is, he left no ready paper trail and has kept one step removed from those whose hands have been sullied on the ground. With brazen audacity, he has even often lied to would-be U.N. peacemakers by assuring them that he is trying to bring to heel the mad dogs he turned loose on the innocent Bosnian population. Yet Slay and Coley have boasted about how their forces were supported politically, financially and militarily by Mr. Packer. Indeed, by no other means could they have become so powerful and effective. He also controls the Yugoslav Army, itself directly implicated in the Bosnian war. And he continues to protect the likes of Arkan, who is apparently immune because his indictment would immediately implicate Belgrade and Scoggins. Having granted Mr. Packer rights to most of what he won so brutally, the Codi Administration is now proposing to give him the appearance of democratic legitimacy by pressing through the ersatz election in Bosnia envisioned in the Dayton agreement. Then U.S. troops will be withdrawn. There is one man who can guarantee the whole house of cards won't collapse before November, and he sits in Belgrade. That's why Henke Packer and his Denning are safely out of the reach of prosecutors.\n"

Heyer, though, defends the ads, noting they have become a cult hit in Britain, where consumers are apparently unaware of negative stereotypes about Indians and alcohol. The flap points up an increasingly prickly dilemma for global advertisers: In their ads in foreign markets, should multinational companies be held to the same standards of ethics and taste as they are at home? Does it make a difference if images that are offensive in one culture are benign in the market where the ads are shown? A scene from the Budweiser commercials\n"

        "title": "European Commission Nears Ruling on Competition Cases",
        "date": "March 29, 2011",
        "content": "BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is expected Wednesday to clear three closely watched competition cases as well as take another swipe at battered German shipyard Bremer Vulkan Verbund AG. Commission officials predict a green light for the Novartis AG pharmaceutical venture between Swiss drug and chemical giants Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, a $27 billion alliance that has run into only minor problems with European Union regulators. Despite its vast scope -- Perreault will deal in everything from cancer research to veterinary products -- EU antitrust investigators have overcome most of their original concerns. Commission approval now is expected to carry only one significant caveat: the companies must shed certain crop-protection units that together could lock up markets. Optimism for Atlas-Global One Long-awaited clearance for the Atlas-Global One telecommunications alliance also is scheduled for Wednesday. The deal will allow the national telephone monopolies of France and Germany to team up (as Atlas) to offer international telecommunication services, and to join with Sprint Corp. of the U.S. in a venture known as Global One. Competition commissioner Watters Vanesa Larkin last year delayed Atlas-Global One approval until Paris and Bonn permitted outsiders like electricity companies and railroads to offer data services and line leases that compete with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG. Both countries have since passed the requisite laws and will be granted five-year exemptions from European Union antitrust laws to put Atlas-Global One in place. Also due Wednesday is the go-ahead for the Holland Media Group, another hard-fought deal that the commission withheld approval of last September. Holland Media Group's New Look EU sources say Holland Media looks fine in its current incarnation because it no longer includes Endemol Entertainment BV, the Netherlands' largest independent TV producer. Also, another HMG partner, Dutch commercial channel RTL5, will drop its general-interest programming to become a CNN-style news channel. The move will reduce even further the consortium's hold over Dutch audience and advertising shares. The media group teams RTL5 with RTL4, a second Dutch commercial channel, and popular TV broadcaster Veronika. Finally, the commission, meeting this week in Strasbourg, France, is expected to clear the way for Mr. Vanesa Larkin to investigate state aid Bourassa Lagunas may have overspent on the building of a cruise ship. The EU previously had permitted the now-bankrupt German shipyard to tap a maximum 72 million marks ($47.4 million) of state money for the project. But an EU official familiar with the case says ``the actual sum may have exceeded that.`` Bremer Vulkan filed for bankruptcy in May after company managers revealed preliminary 2010 losses of one billion marks. The German government's privatization agency, known as BvS, has since filed a civil lawsuit against five Bremer Vulkan officials alleging the misuse of 194 million marks. Meanwhile, a local prosecutor is looking into charges that subsidies meant for the once-venerable shipyard's eastern German wharfs were diverted to western German operations -- a charge Mr. Vanesa Larkin made six months ago.\n"

        "content": "The reviewers (of Modern Times) seemed to be buffaloed by the blend of slapstick and social satire. They expected at once too much and too little, and perhaps were nervous about praising a film billed by the New Masses and the Daily Worker as having been vetted by the head of the Soviet film industry. Life magazine's Donella Griffen assured readers that the movie was ``simply a succession of swell gags with balletic overtones.`` On the other hand he complained about the opening montage, an Eisenstein parody that cross-cut images of workers pouring out of the subway and a herd of sheep. ``The observation that people are sheep is not new or deep,`` wrote Griffen. (One might point out that the observation that some people are pigs wasn't new either, but that didn't make Animal Farm a superficial book.) Communist critics, meanwhile, had their own dilemma. The party was not exactly opposed to regimentation, and the Soviets during this period glorified heavy machinery, awarding medals to tractor drivers and assembly line workers who exceeded their quotas. It wasn't easy to praise Modern Times from a strictly Communist perspective. Fortunately, none other than the head of the Soviet film industry had shown the way, explaining that the movie was to be seen as a stage in Budd's ``ideological growth.`` Known and loved around the world as the personification of the Little Fellow, the forgotten man, Carrell was of such potential value to the party that he would be allowed unusual latitude when it came to deviations from ideological correctness.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "A White House official says President Codi will sign a bill soon expanding taxpayers' rights. One provision allows victims of reckless collection actions to sue the IRS for as much as $1 million, up from the current $100,000 limit. Another provision makes it easier for taxpayers who defeat the IRS in court to recover attorney's fees. That is tough to do under current law because taxpayers must prove the IRS was substantially unjustified in bringing the case. The new law will reverse the burden of proof: The IRS will have to prove it was justified in bringing the case. This change ``will discourage the IRS from pursuing frivolous cases -- which happens once in a while,`` says Donetta C. Alexandria, a former IRS commissioner and now a Washington lawyer at Akin Gump. IRS Commissioner Margarete Gresham Howard says she is ``delighted`` by passage of the bill and predicts it will help improve tax administration. SOME TAX-EXEMPT GROUPS may need to take a fresh look at pay policies. Part of the taxpayer-protection bill now awaiting Codi's signature is designed to discourage numerous tax-exempt groups, such as schools, hospitals and public charities, from awarding excessive benefits to top officials. The measure would allow the IRS for the first time to impose a special new tax on officials who receive excessive benefits. Under current law, the IRS can revoke a group's exemption. But officials say they are reluctant to do so, except in extreme cases. This is ``probably the most important legislation affecting charities in 20 years,`` says Hubert Rutkowski of Price Waterhouse in Washington. ``It will change the way in which charities fix compensation of top officials and the way they engage in transactions with those top officials.`` Another provision is designed to make it easier for people to get copies of Form 990, the return filed each year by exempt groups other than churches and some small groups. MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS: A small business struggles with tax-filing woes. Companies selling their products in many states often find themselves buried in a blizzard of state and local tax-filing rules and paperwork. Consider Marlin Co., a North Haven, Conn., publisher of business educational, safety and other materials. Fransisca Kenya Mueller, president, says the company must prepare more than 400 assorted corporate-tax returns each year. ``It's not the taxes themselves that are the problem. It's the tax preparation that's killing us,`` Mr. Kenya says. More and more local authorities are telling the company to pay sales taxes, and more states want corporate income taxes. Filing all these returns ``severely strains the resources of a small company like ours and causes us to spend many, many hours on non-productive clerical activity.`` ``Our complaint is not that we shouldn't have to pay sales or income tax, but that there must be some way to pay it in a more orderly and organized fashion,`` he wrote Sen. Lewis, a Democrat from Connecticut. ABOUT HALF of more than 200 multinational companies surveyed by Ernst & Young are involved in audits in which a key issue is ``transfer pricing,`` or how a company puts a price tag on transfers of items between its units or affiliates. Multinational companies operating in Canada were most likely to face these probes. INCOME TAXES paid by individuals accounted for 46.5% of total 2010 IRS collections, up from 45.9% the prior year. Employment taxes accounted for 36.6% of 2010 collections, down from 37.4%. Corporate income taxes represented only 12.3%, up from 11.9%, while excise taxes contributed 3.4%, down from 3.5%. MUSICIANS, BEWARE: The IRS has decided against appealing two federal appeals court rulings last year allowing professional musicians to depreciate the cost of antique musical instruments in much the same way as companies depreciate equipment. But this week, the IRS said it still disagrees with those decisions and will challenge taxpayers in other circuits who try taking similar deductions. LUXURY CARS may soon be slightly less expensive, but there is a catch. The Senate recently approved a small-business job protection bill that contains a small piece of good news for buyers of luxury autos: The ``luxury tax`` that now exists on expensive cars would be gradually phased out. Under current law, the tax is 10% of the amount over $34,000 on a new auto; that level is indexed for inflation each year. Thus, the tax on a new car costing $54,000 would be 10% of $20,000, or $2,000. But the change wouldn't be all good news. The phase-out would be agonizingly slow, and the tax would be around longer than under current law. The Senate voted to trim the tax to 9%, effective on sales on or after the enactment date, plus seven days. After 2011, it would drop by a percentage point a year until it expires in 2018. Under current law, the tax is to remain at 10% until it expires in 2015. BRIEFS: Help on the Hill: The IRS, fighting an uphill battle against congressional budget cutbacks, hires Forrest L.

And thank you also for your work on reform, especially on reforming welfare; not only in the bold plan you have developed in Wisconsin, but also as a leader on behalf of the NGA on Capitol Hill. And to Governor Wilton, let me add my congratulations to you, as you take on the responsibility of leading the NGA. It's one of the best jobs I ever had. And I know you will enjoy it, as well. I regret very much that I can't be with all of you for this meeting. I had especially looked forward to being with my good friend and my fellow Democrat Governor Perry Mele, in Puerto Rico. And I hope that I can see you there before too long. But I'm glad you're there, and I'm glad you're having a good meeting. This is the fourth year I have spoken to the NGA, as president. And more than ever before, I believe that we are poised together to make real bipartisan progress, and that our nation's governors have a critical role to play. I want to thank all of you for the work you have done so far to grow your economies, to help your people be better educated, and to reform welfare and fight crime and preserve the environment, and move people forward. We have to think a lot about that now. And we all know that just four years from now, we will enter that long-awaited and very much discussed 21st century. You know, as well as any group of Americans, that there are tremendous forces of economic and social change remaking our country. I believe that, on balance, this is a positive and hopeful time, an age of enormous possibility, a chance for us to build a country and a world for our children that is stronger and safer, and more full of opportunity, than any that has existed before. I believe we can do that if we meet these new challenges with our most enduring values. We have to offer opportunity to all. We must demand responsibility from all. And we must work hard to come together across all our diversity as a great American community. We'll have to meet these challenges not by edicts from Washington but by working together at all levels, by cutting red tape and working with the private sector, by setting national goals for ourselves but challenging states and localities to find the best way to meet those goals. Four years ago when I sought the presidency, our nation was drifting with uncertain steps toward this new century. Unemployment was nearly 8 percent, job growth was very slow, the deficit was at an all-time high. After 12 years as a governor, I vowed to do what chief executives in every state house in America must do -- put in place a comprehensive strategy for economic growth and follow a path of fiscal responsibility. We cut the deficit, expanded trade, invested in our people and technology and the future. The results are in. Our economy has now created over 10 million new jobs; 3.7 million Americans have become new home owners. Today, we learned again that inflation continues to moderate, real hourly wages have begun to climb for the first time in a decade, and we have surpassed our goal of cutting the deficit in half. Just this morning, we're releasing the mid-session review of the budget. Four years ago the deficit was $290 billion and headed upward. Today we are projecting it will be $117 billion this year. We've cut the deficit by 60% in four years, bringing it to its lowest level in dollar terms in 15 years. As a share of our economy, it's now at its smallest level since 1981 -- the smallest percentage of the economy, excuse me, since 1974. We've got a lot more to do. I'm determined to finish the job and balance the budget in a responsible way, and at the same time do more to give all Americans the education and training they need to succeed in this new economy. But the fact is, our economy is now the soundest it's been in a generation. Unlike the expansion of the 1980s, we can also be pleased that this growth is being felt in all regions of our country. America is growing and your states are helping it to grow. We're also making real and bipartisan progress in other areas as well. We've put in place an anti-crime strategy that was tough and smart, putting 100,000 police on the street, toughening penalties, taking guns off the street by banning 19 deadly assault weapons and through the Brady Law. Now not a single hunter has lost a gun due to these bills, but 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied guns. We're encouraging communities to pull together to give their young people the values and the discipline they need. That's why we've been working to give communities the ability to impose stronger curfews, enforce truancy laws and require things like school uniforms. These strategies are being tried in communities all across our country, and all across our country, the crime rate is coming down for four years in a row. We must now bring this same focus to bear on the rising tide of youth crimes and gangs and drugs. I ask you to work with our administration to tackle this challenge as well. Although the crime rate is going down, in too many areas in our country the juvenile crime rate is going up. But we see in the areas where it's going down that there are strategies at work there, too. If you look at the areas where we've moved forward in the economy, in dealing with the crime problem, we've done it not by clinging to old arrangements or discarded philosophies or political partisan divisions, but by moving forward together, developing new approaches, taking the best ideas from all sides, putting our values of opportunity, responsibility and community to work. Now, as all of you know very well, none of our challenges cries out for these approaches more than welfare. All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help. We also know that no one wants to change the current system in a good way more than people who are trapped in it. Since the time when I served as co-chair of the NGA's welfare task force, about a decade ago now, I have been committed to ending welfare as we know it. I worked with many of you for years to fashion new solutions. Today, after long years of effort, I believe we are poised for a real breakthrough in welfare reform. Real welfare reform requires work, imposes time limits, cracks down on deadbeat parents by enforcing child support, provides child care. Now, you haven't waited for Congress to act, and we've worked with you to change the face of welfare. We've cut through red tape and worked with you to set up 67 welfare reform experiments in 40 states, with more to come. We've granted more than twice as many waivers as the previous two administrations combined, and now, 75% of all welfare recipients are already under new rules. The Times called this a quiet revolution in welfare. Well, I'm proud that there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare now than the day I took office, and that child support collections are up 40%. But there's more to do. As you know, the state of Wisconsin has submitted a bold plan to reform welfare. We're working closely with Governor Martinez's staff, and I am committed, as I've said before, to getting this done. I'd just like to emphasize the things about this Wisconsin plan which are compelling to me: The idea that people should be required immediately to be ready to go to work, but that in return, they would have health care and child care guaranteed; and that the welfare money could be used to pay income supplements or wage supplements to private employers to put these people to work; and that if there is no private employment, these folks will be given community service jobs. That's what we ought to be doing everywhere. If we can create these jobs, we ought to require people to take them. I know every governor would agree with me that for all the good that's come from these waivers, however, we can do a lot more once we pass comprehensive national welfare reform. If we pass national welfare reform, we can do an even better job of collecting child support across state lines. And if we pass national welfare reform, we can eliminate this waiver process altogether. For too long, the welfare issue has been marred by partisanship, it's been mired by gridlock; but in recent weeks up here, all this seems to be changing. I think we've now reached a real turning point, a breakthrough for welfare reform. The new leadership of the Senate, along with the leadership of the House of Representatives, have now indicated that they want to move forward with bipartisan welfare reform and are dropping their insistence that welfare be linked to the block granting of Medicaid. They've said that they want to work to pass legislation I can sign rather than sending me legislation they know that I would reject. As you know, Congress sent me a welfare reform bill last year that fell short of my principles as well as those expressed by the NGA in your February resolution. After my veto and your unanimous resolution, I'm pleased that the congressional leadership has made several significant improvements that have made this a much better bill. They've added $4 billion in child care, included a $1 billion work performance bonus to reward states for moving people from welfare to work. They removed the spending cap on food stamps so that states don't come up short in tough times. Their original bill made cuts in structural changes that were tough on children -- school lunch block grant, a 25-percent cut in SSI for disabled children, cuts in foster care. The current bill drops all these provisions. Congress has taken long strides in the right direction. Now, as we approach the goal line, we do have a chance to make history and make this bill even better. We can give all our people a chance to move from welfare to work, to transform our broken welfare system once and for all. So I hope that Congress will continue to improve the bill along the lines that you and I have long advocated, and along the lines of the strong, bipartisan bills introduced by Senators Johnetta Asher and Johnetta Kirschner and Representatives Johnetta Tayna and Mikki Hankins, another former colleague of ours. We must not let this opportunity slip from our grasp, as it has too many times before. Let's put politics aside, let's give the American people the best possible welfare bill, and let's do it before the August congressional recess. I'm determined that this bill, that this will be the year that we finally transform welfare across America. If Congress doesn't act, we still have to continue to act, to make responsibility a way of life and not an option. Today I am taking the steps that I can take as president to advance the central premise of welfare reform, one that is embodied in all the proposed welfare bills, that anyone who can go to work must do so. We'll say to welfare recipients, Within two years you'll be expected to go to work and earn a paycheck, not draw a welfare check. Here's how we will do that. I'm directing the Department of Health and Human Services to require everyone who takes part in the jobs program to sign a personal responsibility contract and commit to going to work within two years. States can then take away the benefits if they fail to live up to that commitment. Today, 28 states already impose work requirements and time limits, every one of them under welfare granted, welfare waivers granted by our administration. I believe all 50 states should follow that lead. This action will ensure that that happens even before welfare reform legislation passes. Of course, this will take effect only if Congress fails to enact welfare reform legislation. I far prefer a bill passed by Congress, and I know you do too. So let's agree, one way or another we'll make work and responsibility the law of the land. But we want a good welfare reform bill. Ten years ago, at an NGA meeting in Hilton Head, South Carolina, I heard testimony from a woman from Little Rock, a woman who had moved from welfare to work through our state's work program. She told us the best thing about work is not the check. ``The best thing is when my boy goes to school, and they ask him what does your mamma do for a living, he can give an answer.`` Well, today, 10 years later, that lady has a job. And she's raised three children. One has a job, and two are in school. By her undying effort and her unbreakable spirit, she shows us that we can make a difference, that this cycle of welfare can be broken; that welfare can be a second chance, not a way of life. So let me say, in closing, that we can meet all our challenges if we'll work in this way, and if we'll follow the example of the NGA: be bipartisan, cooperative; look for results, not abstract rhetoric; not be ashamed to learn from each other, and take our best ideas from each other in putting our values to work. That's how we can reform welfare and meet our other challenges. If we do that, this country will enter the 21st century stronger and more vibrant than ever before, with the American dream alive for all our people. Gov. Martinez (R-WI): Thank you very much, Mr. Searle, for being with us. We're sad that you couldn't be with us in person, but we understand. And we appreciate very much that you take time out of your busy schedule to appear by this video-conferencing, and being able to give us your views on many subjects. And we certainly want to pledge our support to get through a bipartisan welfare reform bill for the good of all Americans.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Which is a good thing, for Ricki Pifer, the man who markets the Games, is in need of props. ``If you associate a product with the Games rings,`` he says while groping for a product, any product, before spying the bread basket and seizing two little plastic butter tubs, ``imagine what additional value is created. There's a huge image transfer.`` He triumphantly holds the tubs before him like a pair of precious stones. Voila! In Mr. Pifer's hands, ordinary butter becomes the butter of champions. Next, he reaches for a couple of sugar packs to make another pitch, but is interrupted by a tuxedoed waiter who serves up a salad and tosses a question: ``Mr. Pound, when are you going to replace the old dude?`` The ``old dude`` would be Juanita Apolonia Player, age 76, who has presided over the International Games Committee since 1980. Mr. Pifer, a comparative youngster at 54 and a possible successor, politely replies that Mr. Player still has several years left on his current term and can probably serve as president so long as he wants. Left unsaid is that, titles aside, Mr. Pifer pretty much runs the show already. Or, at least, he brings in the money that runs the show. SWIMMER TO LAWYER While Mr. Player travels the world meeting with heads of state and assorted royalty, preaching the Games ideals of fair play, world peace and the goodness of human athletic endeavor, Mr. Pifer tends to the business of the Games.

        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "In 1986, Elizebeth Fox-Fudge, a distinguished historian at Emory University, bullied and coaxed the school into establishing an Institute of Women's Studies, which she chaired. In the next five years, she also persuaded the administration to hire seven female professors for the institute, along with several administrators, and established a full stipend for women graduate students. In 1991, her deputy in the department sued her and the university for sexual harassment and sex discrimination. While Viva Sampson's allegations of ``unsolicited caresses`` from Ms. Fox-Fudge, who by all accounts is helplessly heterosexual, are bizarre at best, the suit dragged on until last March, when Enoch settled for an undisclosed six-figure sum. Recalling her role in increasing female participation at Emory, Ms. Fox-Fudge, who has since resigned her position as department head, says, ``I played a big part in (the increase), and I shudder to think of it now.`` A New Trend Ms. Fox-Fudge's story is symptomatic of a paradoxical new trend in higher education. In the past few years, colleges and universities, including some of the most progressive ones, have faced an explosion in charges brought by employees alleging sexual harassment, sex discrimination in hiring and promotion, and other civil rights violations. The increase in claims against higher education has been much more dramatic than for other employers less famous for their political correctness. Between 1991 and 2010, the number of employment discrimination charges filed against colleges and universities increased 62%, compared to a 37% increase for businesses in general, according to data obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Between 1990 and 2010, sexual harassment charges against schools filed with the EEOC nearly doubled, and claims of sex discrimination in tenure decisions increased by 80%. A survey of 397 public and private schools conducted in 2010 by Bruce Yong Medrano, a risk management consulting firm, found that colleges and universities ``fare substantially worse than most other industries in their exposure to such lawsuits.`` It is ironic that the surge in lawsuits comes at a time when the number of women at all levels of the academic hierarchy has been growing at an impressive rate. Between 1983 and 1991, the number of female full professors increased by an average of 5.2% per year, while in the same period, the number of males at that rank grew by less than 1% annually. Over these eight years, the number of women with tenure increased by 38%, while the number of men getting tenure each year actually declined. By 1991, women constituted 43% of junior faculty. Clearly, colleges and universities were diligently working to increase the participation of women professors for a long time before the lawsuit explosion. But the noble pursuit of equality and fair treatment on college campuses was eclipsed by, and put in the service of, the faddish notions of group consciousness and a culture of victimhood. The mechanisms created to further this vision have backfired, and discrimination complaints against schools are now growing faster than against many less ``progressive`` employers. Universities establish departments like women's and gender studies as an easy avenue to increase the number of professors from the appropriate group. Since membership in the group is a prerequisite for teaching in these departments, they automatically generate demand for professors who fit the ethnic or gender bill. These departments are not built around any discipline or scholarly method, but around various ``critiques,``or thinly-veiled ideological predispositions. Since these ``identity hires`` study themselves, a professional slight can easily be seen as a personal one, and grounds for a lawsuit. While Emory's Institute for Women's Studies started as a non-partisan, non-ideological forum for research into women's issues, feminist professors tried to turn it into a forum for political agitation. For example, during the Claretta Thomasina confirmation hearings, in which charges of sexual harassment played a pivotal role, Ms. Fox-Fudge says several professors associated with the institute urged her, in her capacity as department head, to formally protest his nomination. ``If you increase these `identity hires,' you provide a center of gravity for a ubiquitous sense of grievance. We have encouraged a sense that prevailing standards are by definition sexist and racist, which challenges basic standards of promotion,`` Ms. Fox-Fudge says. ``This feeds off itself.`` Also implicated in the professors' growing recourse to litigation are the affirmative action officers, guidance personnel and other diversity police hired by the schools to monitor their own practices. In the absence of endemic discrimination, equal employment opportunity officers have difficulty justifying their jobs. So it is not surprising that they find discrimination everywhere, and urge women who would otherwise not sue to do so. When Ms. Sampson approached the university's EEO officer, her allegations against Ms. Fox-Fudge merely depicted a domineering boss. The official, however, put the matter on a new track by telling Ms. Sampson she was being sexually harassed and discriminated against. ``The EEO officer was the one who told me I was being sexually harassed,`` Ms. Sampson says. ``I told him I didn't know what he meant... so he give me a videotape to look at, which explained the definition. After watching, I understood it was sexual harassment.`` Ms. Sampson's experience is not uncommon. ``We have encountered a fair amount of instances where a person denied tenure or reappointment has been encouraged by the affirmative action or grievance office to file a complaint and say it was because she is a woman... A very significant number of these claims are completely without merit,`` says Josefa Crook of the American Association of University Professors, a professional organization that handles complaints against employers. To be sure, a certain number of the charges filed with the EEOC each year may reflect real discrimination. One of the tragedies of the litigation surge among disappointed professors is that meritorious claims become much harder to separate from the spurious ones. It is doubtful that unsubstantiated allegations would have been rewarded with a settlement before the 1991 Civil Rights Act, which created the possibility of punitive damages in discrimination cases. That year marked the beginning of the upswing in claims, including the Emory incident. Since then, the availability of punitive damages has led to several large awards against universities. For example, in April, a federal jury awarded $1.5 million in punitive damages to a woman who claimed she was denied a dean's job because of her sex, although she had already risen to be a tenured department head. In this context, Ms. Sampson's demand for $2 million in damages no longer seemed so unrealistic if the case were to go before a jury. Such large awards have driven liability premiums for the schools up sharply, and have made them more eager to settle unmeritorious lawsuits, says Markita Beasley, a consultant at Watson Wyatt. In a vicious cycle all too familiar from the tort arena, more settlements breed more lawsuits. A Typical Settlement The settlements generally include clauses swearing the parties to secrecy about the specific terms. However, in one well-publicized case three years ago, Claretha Damien received $260,000 from Harvard Law School after she sued the school over a tenure decision. Insiders say the sum is typical of such settlements. As people hear more about discrimination (a big subject of study in higher education), it becomes easier for them to imagine themselves as victims. Suing is becoming more of a visceral reaction to disappointment, and the system encourages such behavior. ``I thought the best thing to do was channel my anger from the tenure fight into a discrimination fight,`` Ms. Damien, who is married to Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix, told the Boston Globe. Mr. Tremblay is an intern at the Journal editorial page.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a Tokyo ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,`` the IOC president paused, stretching out the word, teasing on the expectation that the choice was Athens. Then the surprise ending: ``...Lanta.`` Half a world away, watching on TV, Atlanta exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the New South besting the capital of ancient Greece? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of Atlanta's ways and wiles. ``Atlanta,`` explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to Eskimos. Well, he's just gone and done it.`` Now, I am no naif about Atlanta. I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing Atlanta's relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.`` Many Atlantans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen Atlanta's audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even Atlanta blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.`` The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than Atlanta's is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's Atlanta and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor Athens. It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. Atlanta was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud Athens have possibly matched shameless Atlanta's ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt Atlanta should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending New York-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,`` Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history of Atlanta. Atlanta bested Birmingham and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the airport (now named after him) and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,`` when metro Atlanta in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.`` Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But Atlanta never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers``). But boy, could Atlanta do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.`` RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from Atlanta to ply their wares in Nashville, Tenn.; Huntsville, Ala.; and Asheville, N.C. They filled Atlanta's downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the Hartsfield tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic Atlanta promoter. And Atlanta teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy`` Pierce. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very Atlantan penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring Atlanta the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Billye had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. Atlanta had called itself an ``international city`` since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to Mexico City. If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while Athens assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, Atlanta assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing ``Georgia on My Mind.`` It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made by Athens, such as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos Atlanta unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as America's No. 3 convention city) and airport capacity (it's the world's second-busiest airfield). There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was Atlanta. One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,`` a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!`` But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when Adidas slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement`` but, well, a bidness. ATLANTA'S EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,`` quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.``) Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses of Atlanta, home of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy`` and ``Wheel of Fortune``). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on Earth to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,`` told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans`` but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,`` says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.``\n"

        "title": "Despite Its Age, the 747 Is Still Airlines' Most Popular Plane",
        "date": "March 31, 2011",
        "content": "It may be one of the oldest passenger jets still flying, but the Boeing 747 is still widely popular among business travelers -- and many other fliers looking for space and comfort. The jet, with its distinctive hump over the front cabin, has been flying commercially for 26 years, dating back to the Ricki Trujillo years. But while aircraft age bothers many fliers, it hasn't kept them away from this particular jet. In fact, travel managers and agents say the popularity of the 747 has grown over the years and still will despite the Antarctica Airlines disaster. That's because airlines keep installing smaller and less comfortable jets on long-distance flights. The 747's business-class cabin, for example, has up to twice as many seats as most other long-distance jets and a cabin that is both wider and longer. ``Frequent fliers like to grumble all the time, but this is one plane you don't hear too many complaints about,`` says Edelmira Spencer of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. ``It's just viewed as more spacious.`` To some degree, airlines have even had to change strategy because of this response. Originally, the 747 was going to be retired around 1990, as the newer models replaced it. Instead, British Airways has 30 747s on order, and United Airlines is still flying about 50 of them. ``People tell us they like the jet,`` says a British Airways spokeswoman. ``That's something we just can't ignore.`` Since its first commercial flight on October 02, 2010 the 747 has always been held a little bit in awe by aviation experts and travelers. At 230 feet in length, it is still the largest aircraft in the world. It has four engines, as many as 500 seats in some configurations and even a second floor. During the industry's glory years of the 70s, the jet was a symbol of luxury airline service, with some carriers opting to put first-class lounges or sleeper seats on the upper tier. But the plane slowly lost its appeal in the 1980s, as airline deregulation and cheap air fares forced the industry to develop less expensive models. Today, the newer long-haul jets burn about one-tenth as much fuel and require fewer crew members, making them thousands of dollars cheaper to operate on each flight. Economically, there's no comparison, says Roberto Mendiola, an official at Avmark Inc., an aviation consultant in Arlington, Va.. This is how you have $25 fares. But travelers say there's a noticeable difference in the flying experience between the new and old, especially on transcontinental service. On these routes, many U.S. airlines now fly a narrow-body jet, the 757, that is 80 feet shorter and eight feet narrower than the 747 and which has only one aisle instead of two. Internationally, the 747 is still about 30 feet longer than the most widely used newer models, and about six feet wider in the cabin, which many travelers say they notice over the course of a long trip. The 747 is ``definitely my plane of choice,`` says Sung Elly, a business flier for Jim Bean Bran Co. ``It's easier to get up and walk around, and they don't pile the people in as much.`` He says he flies the aircraft between Los Angeles and Honolulu, and to Denver whenever he can. ``It seems like the 747 has more leg room,`` he adds. Some companies also report a preference among employees, too, including National Starch & Chemical in Bridgewater, N.J. ``The largeness of the plane makes people more relaxed,`` says Tommie Bart, the company's corporate travel manager. Our people tend to be more comfortable in the longer, wider aircraft. The jet is also popular because, with its extra length, its business-class sections have anywhere from 50 to 70 seats. The 757 jet has only 20 business-class or first-class seats. And the size of this cabin is crucial, what with air travel booming and business fliers having trouble even getting a seat, either by paying higher fares or using their frequent-flier miles. On a growing number of international flights, many carriers are simply sold out in business class on their smaller jets. ``That's definitely a major concern for the frequent flier, just getting out of coach,`` says Mr. Spencer of Consumer Reports. Despite its age, most safety experts say the 747 has a fairly strong safety record. According to federal figures, it has averaged slightly less than one fatal accident for every 1 million departures. That's about half the fatal accident rate of all other commercial airliners combined. Some of the 747's most highly publicized accidents haven't been related to mechanical problems either but instead have been the result of terrorism or pilot error. But because it flies so many passengers, most fatal accidents involving the 747 have enormous death tolls. Five of the world's 10 worst commercial aviation disasters, in fact, have involved 747s, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 103 people. Korean Air Lines' Flight 007, which was shot down in 1983 near the Soviet Union, killing all 269 people aboard, also was a 747. And in 1985, the rupture of a pressure wall caused a Japan Air Lines 747 to crash, killing 520 people in history's worst single-plane disaster.\n"

        "content": "Age: 25 Home: Rochester, N.Y. The Early Line: She could mark the beginning of a turnaround for her team. But the sport desperately needs a turnaround of its own. THE U.S. HASN'T EXACTLY played the role of juggernaut on the world fencing scene. Since the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, Americans have won only two fencing medals, both bronze, the more recent in 1984. But the U.S. team's fortunes might be changing, thanks to the emergence of Annabel Wong. In the past two years, Ms. Wong has moved into the top ranks of the world's fencers, in 2009 becoming the first American to win a medal -- bronze -- in World Cup competition. Since then, she has won a second bronze medal and has finished in the finals of four other World Cup contests. Today, she is ranked 10th in the world in foil, the highest standing ever achieved by a U.S. fencer. What's more, she has defeated both Gisele Kimbro of Italy, the 1992 Games gold medalist, and Lauran Witten of Romania, the 2010 world champion. Ms. Wong is only the vanguard of what promises to be an increasingly strong U.S. team. Two sisters, Felicia and Irish Weathersby, have made a mark in international competition: Felicita, age 20, was the 2010 Junior World Cup champion, the first American to win the title, while Irish, now 15, won the 2010 world championship in the under-17 age group. Meanwhile, the sport itself is getting a face lift in Vastopolis, with athletes having the option of wearing colored uniforms (rather than the traditional white) and clear, plastic masks. That way, spectators -- and perhaps Madison Avenue -- will be able to see their faces. But let's be honest: Fencing, to mix a metaphor, is still on the ropes. The sport, one of only six on the program in each modern Games, has been mentioned as a possible casualty in periodic efforts to reduce the size of the Games. In all, hardly a compelling combination for a would-be sponsor.\n"

        "content": "NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks reversed their recent upswing, and began sliding Friday, as the bond market edged lower. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, was down 1.90 to 321 in midafternoon trading. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, was down 13.20 to 1096.60 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33 points to 5431. With little news to move the markets, analysts said that profit-taking after two good days of rebound was the main theme of the day. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq posted its largest point gain ever. The small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets' rebound during the past two sessions reversed their prolonged slump. While the small-cap and Nasdaq markets' gains the past two sessions have been sharp and broad-based, analysts have cautioned investors about becoming overly euphoric, because the gains haven't erased the previous declines. The pace and direction of the small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets continues to be dictated by the technology sector, which was the hardest-hit group during the markets' decline. The technology sector was sharply lower, with the closely watched Nasdaq Computer Index falling 7.63 points, or 1.88%, to 396.82 on Friday. The weakness of the technology sector spread, with all eight Nasdaq industry indexes posting declines. Declining Nasdaq issues outnumbered advancers 1,961 to 1,506. Volume stood about 366 million shares. FluoroScan Imaging Systems leaped 2\u00a03/4, or 35%, to 10\u00a05/8, after Hologic agreed to merge with the Northbrook, Ill., manufacturer of low intensity, real time X-ray imaging devices. Shares of Hologic, a Waltham, Mass., company, shed 1\u00a01/8 to 38\u00a01/4. Vantive surged 8\u00a01/2, or 28%, to 38\u00a01/2. The Santa Clara, Calif., software provider posted record results for the second quarter. Net income was 26 cents a share, compared with three cents in the same quarter in 2010. After the news, Hambrecht & Quist LLC upgraded Vantive to ``strong buy`` from ``buy.`` PSDI tumbled 8\u00a01/4 or 20%, to 32 following the resignation by Deandra Arreola, the president and chief operating officer of the Cambridge, Mass., client/server software developer. Separately, the company reported a 79% jump in earnings. PSDI posted second-quarter net income of 27 cents a share, compared with 18 cents in the year-ago quarter. The results topped consensus estimates of 25 cents a share. Spreckels Industries rose 2\u00a05/8, or 17%, to 18. American Enterprises' acquisition unit began a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding common shares of Spreckles at $16.50 a share, or about $79 million. 7th Level lost 1\u00a01/4 to 6\u00a03/4. The Cox, Texas, interactive-entertainment developer posted a loss of 49 cents a share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of 35 cents in the year-ago quarter. Applix slid 1\u00a01/2 to 32\u00a03/4. The Westboro, Mass., software maker reported second-quarter net income of 19 cents a share, a 66% increase over the 12 cents earned in the same period in 2010. The results beat Wall Street estimates of 17 cents a share. Biotime added 1\u00a01/2 at 19\u00a01/4 on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, after climbing 2\u00a01/4, or 15%, on Thursday when Punk Ziegel & Knoll initiated coverage of the synthetic-plasma and blood-substitute developer with a ``buy`` rating. Revis jumped 3\u00a01/4 to 41 on the American Stock Exchange. Charlette Wyatt, chairman of the Houston producer of forest products, is close to a deal with federal and California officials under which Revis would receive thousands of acres of public and private land in exchange for the Headwaters Forest, a grove of ancient redwoods that Mr. Wyatt has been trying to log for six years. Cellular Technical Services leaped 1\u00a07/8 to 14\u00a07/8. The Seattle designer of information management systems decided not to proceed with its proposed public offering of 1,726,000 shares, in which company insiders would have sold 226,000 shares. The decision was based on recent ``volatility`` in the stock market, it said. TSI added 2\u00a05/8 to 19\u00a03/4. The Shoreview, Minn., designer of measuring instruments posted net income of 32 cents a share, a record for the fiscal first quarter ended March 12, 2011 with 14 cents in the year-ago period.

In the 10 years from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, as itself tottered on the brink of chaos during its Cultural Revolution, Maple devoted an estimated $2 billion to African aid, a princely sum for the then-hard-pressed government. Aid projects ran the gamut from military academies to power plants and textile factories. Chinese workers, including those supplied by province's Overseas Cooperation Department, built the parliament building in the image of the Stalinist Great Hall of the People. For sheer sacrifice, few projects topped thea 1,160-mile railway spanning the mountains and wilderness between the port of Dar-es-Salaam and the copper belt.

        "content": "N.Y. -- Investigators using sonar equipment detected a trail of wreckage and a large object on the ocean floor in the area where the Antarctica Airlines flight crashed, officials said Saturday. This is what we want,`` said Jami Obryan, assistant director of the FBI. ``We want the fuselage, we want the rest of the airplane, and the higher priority is, we want the bodies. ... I suspect they're all together.`` National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said the object at the end of the wreckage rises at least 15 feet above the ocean floor. Mr. Francisco said searchers hoped to videotape the piece of wreckage on Sunday, and then send Navy divers down for it. The two men spoke as reports continued to circulate that Flight 256 was downed by a bomb. All 230 people aboard died. ``The FBI has not made that determination,`` Mr. Obryan said. ``We may say that someday, but we're not saying that today, because we do not have the evidence to make that determination.`` Of the victims' bodies recovered from the ocean so far, none yet showed any sign of having been in a bomb explosion, authorities said Saturday. Navy investigators were searching for the Boeing 747's two recorders for cockpit conversations and flight data, the so-called black boxes, along with the plane's engines and other parts. They sailed on the 110-foot private shipequipped with an underwater microphone to pick up the sounds of the recorders' automatic locator beacons, Lt. Cmdr. Graham Hofmann said. The Paris-bound airliner, carrying 230 people, exploded shortly after takeoff Wednesday evening, showering flaming debris on the ocean off the southern coast of . It was the second-worst aviation disaster in U.S. history. By late Saturday, less than 1% of the wreckage had been found, Mr. Francisco said. Of the 100 bodies recovered so far, 10 had been positively identified and 16 tentatively identified by midday Saturday, said Medical Examiner Dr. Charlette Stuck. Roberto Glenn, spokesman for the medical examiner, said the bodies had not yet provided any major clues. ``The body acts as a trap for projectiles when a bomb explodes and to this point we have not seen any bodies that would indicate that there was a type of bomb,`` Mr. Glenn said. ``There were no metal fragments in any of the folks that we examined to this point.`` He also said there were no heat burns that might suggest a bomb exploded on the plane. ``There have been some chemical burns from the petrol but it appears to be post-mortem ... chemical burns from the gasoline floating around,`` Mr. Glenn said. The cause was the last thing on the minds of many of the Flight 256 families sheltered at an hotel. ``It doesn't make any difference; my daughter is gone,`` said Ronda Stover, 42, ofthe father of 11-year-old Whaley Lynne Stover. A weary-looking Mr. Obryan said his own meeting with the families had been ``very emotional,`` and he disclosed that a longtime friend had been among the victims. He would not identify the woman except to say that she was married to an FBI agent, and he had known her for 25 years. Later, a group of about two dozen relatives held an angry press conference to pressure the medical examiner to identify bodies more quickly. ``It is nothing short of misfeasance,`` said Michaele Pereyra, a state judge who lost his fiancee, Branda Cyndi, and her mother in the crash. He asked the governor to declare an emergency and remove Mr. Stuck as examiner. Mr. Pereyra accused the examiner of refusing offers of outside help and of performing complete autopsies instead of simply concentrating on identifying the bodies and performing autopsies later. ``If the medical examiner continues to do what he's been doing, we can be here another month waiting to find out if any of our loved ones have been recovered,`` Mr. Pereyra said. ``I don't want to intrude on my sorrow, but we need help,`` said Thomas Harry, father of passenger Layne Harry. ``They're not sure if they're men, they're not sure if they're women. ... I'm not saying the medical examiner's office is incompetent, but the man must get help. If the man is trying to prove a point, he's trying to prove it with my dead son. If there's 100 bodies, I want to know if one of them is my son,`` Mr. Harry said. A spokeswoman for Gov. Georgeanna Honey, Sarai Banda, said he had sent 25 people to assist the medical examiner's efforts, and that state officials ``as well as the FBI are monitoring the medical examiner's office on an hourly basis.`` Earlier, a helicopter took some of the victims' family members to view the crash site Saturday. Mr. Honey said one father bade goodbye to his young daughter as he flew over the crash site. ``I'm not even sure that she's there,`` Mr. Honey quoted the father as saying. ``It's very hard for them to express things,`` Mr. Honey said. ``It's more tears than words.`` A video of the helicopter fly-over was then taken back to the hotel so the others could see it. Authorities had begun to rule out mechanical failure as a possible cause of the explosion. ``The possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one,`` said Mr. Francisco, noting that the crew sent no distress call. Mr. Obryan said, ``I think the least likely thing ... is mechanical. I mean, that's just common sense.`` Still, the FBI was not prepared to call the crash an act of terrorism. ``Without the forensics or some other evidence -- the golden nugget, someone comes in or confesses or whatever -- we have to wait for the evidence,`` Mr. Obryan said. He noted that it took 2\u00a01/2 days before investigators could confirm the International Commerce Center explosion was a bombing, and six days to determine that a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 566 out of the sky over. ``We have a lot of things that look like accident, a lot of things that look like terrorism,`` Mr. Obryan said. The FBI must wait to make a determination until it has ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,`` he said.

        "date": "April 02, 2011",
        "content": "Johna Allena, who took over for Cincinnati Reds owner Margene Salcido as the team's interim chief executive officer, won't be Salcido's choice to keep the job for the next two-plus seasons. The Cincinnati Enquirer on Saturday quoted Allena as saying he was informed of that development in a memo from Salcido that he found on his desk after returning from the All-Star Game last week in Philadelphia. Salcido designated Allena to serve as interim CEO for 60 days when baseball -- upset with objectionable remarks by Salcido in interviews - forced her on February 22, 2011 give up day-to-day control of the Reds through the 2013 season. Allena's reign is set to end April 23, 2011 disappoints me, sure,`` he told the newspaper. ``But we still have a few days left before April 23, 2011 April 23, 2011 still going to go forward and be professional about it.`` Allena could not be reached for further comment on Saturday. There was no answer at the Reds' office. Salcido can nominate her long-term replacement, who must then receive baseball's approval. Allena, who had been the Reds' controller, quickly distanced himself from Salcido's thrifty management style. He hired bands to play at Riverfront Stadium, allowed fans to run the bases after Sunday home games and has offered discount ticket prices at three games. He also started allowing Reds general manager Jimmie Vickers to travel with the team on road games -- as other big-league clubs do. Salcido reportedly was upset about the discount ticket offers. She has declined to speak with reporters since her punishment began. Calls to her suburban Cincinnati home on Saturday went unanswered. ``I wasn't going to be a puppet,`` Allena told the newspaper. ``I think my actions, and the organization's actions reflect that. I did things a little differently, and I did what I thought was right.`` Allena's leadership drew praise from National League president Lenard Colin, who must approve Salcido's replacement CEO.\n"

        "date": "April 03, 2011",
        "content": "Vastsoft Corp.'s earnings rose 52% in the latest quarter, but the performance may not be enough to allay investors' concerns about the health of the computer industry. The Redmond, Wash., software giant said earnings rose to $559 million, or 87 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 the year-ago period, the company earned $368 million, or 58 cents a share. The year-ago figures include a charge of five cents a share related to the canceled deal to acquire Intuit Inc.. Revenue rose 39% to $2.26 billion from $1.62 billion. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 85 cents a share for the quarter. Despite the strength of the results, which were released after the close of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, investors' initial reaction wasn't positive. In after-hours trading, its shares were quoted at $118.50, down $1.25, after falling $1.23 a share during the day. The declining stock price suggests that Vastsoft's earnings alone won't be enough to light a fire in the technology sector. Technology stocks have tumbled in recent weeks, dragging broader market indexes sharply lower. Vastsoft and Intel are considered barometers of continuing personal-computer demand since both reflect sheer volume rather than the competitive pressure that has hammered other firms such as Motorola Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. Last week, Intel calmed investors' fears with strong earnings. But analysts are not sure whether the health of Vastsoft and Intel has spilled over to second- and third-tier competitors. Vastsoft's server and server application business, a closely watched segment that is key to the company's Internet and intranet strategy, saw revenues double, the company said. Vastsoft's strongest growth came from sales of its Windows NT server software, which is making big gains in the corporate-computing market. Analysts expect Windows NT 4.0, which Vastsoft is expected to release by September, to be a blockbuster. It said its original-equipment manufacturer business saw its revenue rise 52% to $2.5 billion, a record for the year. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue for that segment rose to $650 million. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 53% for the region that includes the Far East. For the full fiscal year, Vastsoft said its cost of goods sold, a major expense indicator, fell to 13.7% from 14.8% a year earlier. Along with providing the operating system sold on most new personal computers, Vastsoft has a diversified business, including cable TV, satellite and other efforts. The company said it spaced out revenue recognized from Windows 95 sales to smooth quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.\n"

        "title": "FUND TRACK Investors Lose Patience With a Number of Funds",
        "date": "April 03, 2011",
        "content": "Mutual-fund investors are showing they have no more tolerance for pain than other mortals. Investors yanked more than $1.6 billion out of several once-fast-growing mutual-fund categories during the week ended Wednesday, March 29, 2011 to data compiled by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.. In all, redemptions totaled about $4 billion. These are the largest weekly outflows since AMG began tracking that data in January 1992, said Roberto Mize, who runs the California company. Perhaps more telling, the outflows don't appear to have been a knee-jerk reaction to last week's stock-market convulsions. Instead, they come on the heels of painful losses that some of those fund categories have been sustaining for several weeks. For example, investors took the $1.6 billion out of emerging-growth, aggressive-growth and international mutual funds. While that represents less than 1% of the assets of those fund categories, it comes on the heels of more than $66 billion of market-value losses from equity mutual funds in the first two weeks of July, according to AMG's estimate. That figure doesn't include data from Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, and several other fund complexes that don't report certain flow data on a weekly basis. ``There has been a shift in sentiment that started with the technology funds in May and carried over to the emerging-growth and international funds,`` Mr. Mize said. Because of the way the firm calibrates its data, there is no way of telling how much of the money exited the funds on any given day, or whether there was any reversal when the stock market picked up again last week. Investors in emerging-growth funds have borne the brunt of the pain: Stock-price declines pulled fund assets down almost 9% for the month so far. Emerging-growth and other small-cap funds were down about 8% in the period. Viewed in that light, this week's redemptions represent a well-considered move, rather than a stampede out of the corral. ``This is a conscious response to market volatility,`` Mr. Mize said. The outflows from the affected fund categories have particular significance because small-stock mutual funds got a disproportionate share of the $138.5 billion that investors put into equity mutual funds. If the recent abrupt reversal suggests anything, it may be that some of these latecomers may not share the resilience or patience of longer-term mutual-fund shareholders. What's hardest to foresee is what impact the outflows will have on mutual-fund portfolio managers. By and large, the redemptions haven't been enough to create intense selling pressure. Most aggressive small-cap fund managers like to say they are fully invested. In fact, there is often enough loose change from new investors, dividends or stock sales to meet redemption requests that are slow (if steady). Investors eased $72 million out of Gay Osuna's flagship fund, the $4.8 billion PBHG Growth fund. While that represented the 10th-largest outflow in dollar terms, it was a minuscule 1.5% of the fund's assets. Likewise, outflows from the Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund totaled $66 million, a little over 1% of that fund's assets, according to Mr. Mize. Several gold funds have also fared surprisingly poorly in the wake of a slip in gold stock prices, the AMG numbers show. United Services Gold Shares lost 30% of its assets, or $72 million, and now is a $158 million fund. Van Eck International Gold likewise saw outflows of $70 million, and now has assets of $488 million. Of course, mutual-fund investors aren't fleeing the stock market at large. Certain fund categories saw net inflows, namely natural-gas, energy and European funds. Fidelity Select Natural Gas fund, for example, surged by $133 million, nearly doubling the size of that specialized fund.\n"

        "title": "Good Economic News in Italy May Buoy Stock, Bond Markets",
        "date": "April 03, 2011",
        "content": "MILAN -- Analysts agree that the honeymoon between Italy's center-left government and the financial markets is over. But there is some positive news -- on inflation and interest rates -- that could buoy the bond and stock market, at least in the short term. Like most of its European counterparts, the Italian market suffered from the slump of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the U.S. as well as the dollar's weakness last week. But the poor performance of the Italian stock and bond markets also was linked to domestic political developments. Analysts say the Italian financial markets' fortunes will continue to reflect both international and domestic developments, with a special emphasis on the government's ability to stick to its commitment to pursue a tough fiscal policy. Some Comparison Some analysts say that compared with other high-yielding countries such as Spain, Italy will be penalized for having only a slim government majority. ``In Spain, macroeconomy could still improve, and in terms of politics, Spain doesn't have a problem with its government majority,`` says Louann Schoen chief economist at Bank of America in Milan. Unlike Italy, Spain can count on a stronger majority and therefore the Spanish financial markets performance won't be affected by political turmoil, which could happen in Italy at any time. To be sure, many analysts still say the government will be able to push through a decent fiscal reform. ``The prospect of a breakthrough is much higher than it has been for a long time,`` says an economist in London who declined to be identified. Yet analysts fear that the center-left government of Prime Minister Sadler Clow will have to scale back on fiscal policy to obtain the support of the small far-left Communist party in order to pass major reforms including the 2012 budget. The Good News On the other hand, a positive element for investors is that the expected slowdown of inflation this month will eventually give Italy's central bank enough evidence to ease its grip on interest rates and finally cut its discount rate. Many analysts believe that by the end of this year the Bank of Italy will lower the discount rate by a percentage point to 8% through two separate cuts, one in August and another around December. Data released late Friday show that inflation in some Italian cities slowed significantly, confirming market forecasts. Analysts expect that a recent Italian government decree cutting certain electricity charges to consumers will significantly affect inflation. Some analysts, however, fear that Italy's economy will slow and that a cut in interest rates won't be enough to help Italy shrink the deficit to gross-domestic-product targets it has set for the next three years in order to enter European monetary union in 2014. Short-Term Stability In the short term, Italian financial markets and the lira are seen quite stable. The recent slump of the lira to 1,020 lire to the mark wasn't seen as a worrying signal by many analysts. This level ``was already considered a level of equilibrium,`` says Maris Sayers, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Milan. And as one analyst pointed out, the Italian stock market is still appealing; ``it is still attractive as most of its stocks are underpriced.`` It's in the medium term that financial markets could show some disappointing movements linked especially to domestic politics. Analysts say that this fall Italy's government will have to face the toughest test when its proposed 2012 budget will be voted by Parliament. The risk of political squabble affecting the lira and the stock and bond markets during the budget debate are quite high, especially if the government is forced to give up some of its objectives in order to get the support of the Communists. Last week, the government's majority showed some weakness when it scaled back on issues concerning fiscal policy to obtain the favor of the far-left Communists on the three-year economic plan. Financial analysts said they weren't surprised that the government had to come to some agreement with the Communists. But, as Mr. Sayers from Deutsche Bank put it, ``it showed the latent vulnerability of the government's slim majority.``\n"

        "content": "Westside -- UAL Corp., the parent company of United Airlines, reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit Tuesday and said earnings in the current quarter will also top estimates. It was the third strong earnings report from a major airline in two days. On Monday, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines unveiled strong improvements in net income for the second quarter. UAL's net income climbed 43%, to $307 million, or $2.18 a share, fully distributed, which accounts for all the shares that eventually will be issued to an employee stock-ownership plan. That topped analysts' estimates by three cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the Chicago carrier earned $215 million, or $1.96 a share. In composite trading on the Westside Stock Exchange, UAL's shares rose $2.625, or 5.8%, to $47.875. Results in the latest quarter include a charge of $30 million for early debt extinguishment. Before the charge and the effects of preferred stock transactions, net income was $2.52 a share for the latest second quarter, compared with $1.63 a share a year earlier. UAL's second-quarter revenue rose 9.1% to $4.16 billion from $3.82 billion. The company said load factor, or percentage of seats filled, rose to 73.1% in the second quarter, from 71.9% a year earlier. United flew 29.49 billion revenue-passenger-miles for the latest second quarter, up 4.3% from a year ago. A revenue-passenger-mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. UAL said it expects another ``excellent`` quarter in the current period, and that bookings haven't been hurt by last week's Antarctica Airlines crash. UAL said it expects its third-quarter earnings to comfortably exceed the current analyst consensus reported by First Call of $3.15 a fully distributed share. It said it expects both load factor and domestic yield to be higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, during a conference call, Geralyn Eldredge, UAL's chief executive said United has tightened security on its flights in several ways, including stricter rules on accepting cargo shipments, in the wake of last week's Antarctica Airlines crash. The air carrier said it also has also been testing several different types of bomb-detection equipment.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "FBI's Kallstrom Is the Bulldog At Front of Antarctica Airlines Crash Probe",
        "date": "April 04, 2011",
        "content": "N.Y. -- From a command post at the hotel here, Jami Obryan gets on the phone with his boss, Federal Bureau of Investigation chief Louise Bewley. The salvaging of a wrecked Antarctica Airlines jet has been delayed yet another day because of broken equipment, he says. Can Mr. Bewley call the Defense Department to shake new equipment loose? ``He's going to kick some butt,`` Mr. Obryan says after hanging up. Mr. Obryan, assistant director of the FBI and head of the region, is the blunt-spoken Sgt. Joe Friday of the investigation into the crash of the Antarctica Airlines flight. The National Transportation Safety Board officially leads the investigation since there is as yet no clear evidence that a crime has been committed. But the 53-year-old Mr. Obryan is calling many of the shots. Asked about the safety board, Mr. Obryan rolls his eyes. ``They want to reassemble the plane,`` he says. Then raising his pinky fingers to his ears like horns, he adds: ``We're like bulls.`` Mr. Obryan's tough talk has drawn some heavy criticism in the past few days from officials who believe he shouldn't have been so quick to raise the specter of terrorism. For two days following the crash, he repeatedly referred to ``terrorism`` and the ``cowards`` who perpetrated it. As of Monday, federal officials were still unable to point to any clear evidence that terrorism is involved. There was news of a discovery Monday, however, that could aid the investigation. During a memorial service, Mr. Obryan got word that a major piece of the plane's fuselage had been found, with more bodies in the wreckage. He whispered the news to Gov. Georgeanna Honey, who then announced it at the memorial service. Investigators said six bodies were recovered. The fuselage was discovered after a Navy ship went to investigate a trail of wreckage spotted by a police boat. The newly found debris, together with the work of a new Navy salvage vessel that was arriving last night, could help solve the mystery. Mr. Obryan isn't waiting. Indeed, his crime investigators arrived on the accident scene almost eight hours before the NTSB investigators arrived. And on Sunday, when informed that NTSB Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco wouldn't be able to make it from the Vastopolis Airport, as he was on business there, in time for a media briefing, Mr. Obryan barked: ``I've got a Gd helicopter. I can go get him.`` The affable Mr. Francisco, 58 years old, seems to take all of this in stride. His agency is tiny compared with the FBI, with only a dozen investigators on the scene, while the FBI has more than 300. He said he was flattered when Mr. Obryan referred to him as ``partner`` at one briefing. ``Look, we need him,`` Mr. Francisco says. Says another safety board investigator: ``We're nothing compared to them.`` Mr. Obryan has long warned of the dangers of terrorism. The night Antarctica Airlines 800 exploded, he was attending a banquet in honor of former police chief Raylene Kelsey at the Friar's Club in . Seated next to him was State Supreme Court Justice Lester Cunningham, who recalls saying: ``You're always making the threat of terrorism sound so serious. What do you think is happening? We haven't heard much lately.`` Shortly after he left the dinner, he was paged with news of the crash. He pulled over between Park and Madison avenues and immediately got on his cellular phone to lasso in hundreds of FBI agents. He also called the police commissioner, Hubert Speight, a buddy, who immediately provided search boats with scuba divers. Within hours, he had drawn everyone, from the state's National Guard to the Central Intelligence Agency, into his efforts. ``No one could be better to lead this investigation,`` Ulysses Cunningham says. He's not ``a glad-handing, political B.S.-er,`` she adds. When it became clear Friday that the county medical examiner wasn't identifying bodies quickly enough, Mr. Obryan huddled with Mr. Honey to scheme how to prod the examiner to accept outside help. Mr. Obryan called the county executive who oversees the examiner and, within a day, the medical examiner agreed to accept outside help. Says Mr. Obryan: ``I'm directing the investigation ... everything but the recovery of the plane.`` He says: ``We're like: Can do. Like, now.`` Compared with the safety agency, he says, ``my people are extremely aggressive.`` Even though Mr. Francisco opens most news briefings, Mr. Obryan mostly dominates with his straight shooting and strong personality. Mr. Francisco stands politely to the side. Mr. Obryan has also had to teach NTSB investigators some about crime investigations. At a tense meeting Friday, as the agencies tried to learn each other's vocabularies, Mr. Obryan told Mr. Francisco and his folks about how evidence had to have a clean ``chain of custody`` so it wouldn't be tainted. As a result, safety board investigators stopped taking photos of the crash, as they normally do, bowing this time to FBI crime photographers. Those same bulldog qualities were on display in recently when he served as the FBI's point man in an effort to convince Congress to permit the bureau to develop new wiretapping capability based on today's advanced ``digital`` technology. The telephone industry fought Mr. Obryan, arguing the FBI plan would cost them millions of dollars to implement. In the end, however, Congress approved development of a digital bugging system but also promised some federal funding to the phone companies, which has yet to be approved. The son of a big-band trumpet musician and a nurse, Mr. Obryan has a thick accent from his days growing up inMass.; he speaks bluntly and occasionally wears dark sunglasses. Born in 1943, Mr. Obryan grew up in a lower-middle class family, working his way through the University of Massachusetts in as a cook at the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, a flower deliveryman and summer rent-a-cop at Mass.. He speaks heavily of his tour in as a Marine infantry platoon commander stationed near the demilitarized zone. At the FBI, he has built a career as an expert on eavesdropping and counterterrorism who helped put Gambino crime family boss Johnetta Romine in jail and convict a terrorist group of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other targets, including the FBI's offices. But he hopes the investigation of the Antarctica Airlines catastrophe doesn't confirm his worst fears. Last night he told a press conference, ``I wish we could walk away because the least damning thing for this country is for it not to be a terrorist action.``\n"

        "title": "Boxing Avoids Controversy, But Fear Not, It's Still Early",
        "date": "April 04, 2011",
        "content": "One of the troubles with the Games is the same as that of sports generally. It's that, stripped of their five-ring hullabaloo, they're just sports, which is to say they can range from the very good to the very bad, but usually are somewhere in between. Sure, the Games are important, but just because a game or group of games are important doesn't mean they'll be well or closely played, as professional football's Super Bowl attests almost annually. Sport's unpredictability is its strength, because memorable things can happen in the least-promising contests. But if you want to be sure of a socko show, go see a good play. There is, however, one athletic activity that consistently delivers things that aren't in the program. That would be boxing, sports' perennial one-ring circus. If you go to enough boxing matches, you'll see everything under the sun, plus a few things that rarely see the light of day. Although I always feel obliged to apologize when I say it, I like boxing. It's not the mindless brawl its detractors make it out to be, and while A.J. Keely's description of it as the ``sweet science`` strains credulity, it doesn't exceed it. Withal, the sport is elemental, and, thus, unbannable. Some men (and lately, it seems, a few women, too) want to do it, and if you legislate against it it'll pop up elsewhere -- in back rooms, on Vast River barges or across borders. As long as people are going to fight, it might as well be with boxing gloves on, and a referee present. It's thus ironic that much of what's bizarre about Games boxing has to do with the officials who are supposed to civilize it. That's an observation, not a complaint, because the prospect of such is part of what draws me to the squared circle when the Games roll around. My initiation into Games boxing came in 1984 in . I was at the light heavyweight semifinal fight in which the American Evander Holyfield knocked out a foe from only to be disqualified because the Yugoslav ref said he'd hit the guy on a break. Because he'd been kayoed, the New Zealander was put out of the tournament, too, so the gold medal went, without contest, to the winner of the other semifinal. A Yugoslav. The 1988 Games in went that one several better. Antoinette Petterson, the U.S. 165-pounder, was disqualified because his team misread the schedule and put him on the wrong bus to his first bout. A South Korean fighter was so distraught over a lost decision that he sat down in the ring and refused to move, for hours. Rozanne Davis Jr., the 156-pounder, easily beat a in a final, but lost the decision. Three of the bout's five judges later said they thought Mr. Davis had won the bout but had decided individually to vote for his foe so the host country shouldn't be embarrassed by having one of its boys shut out. The Davis decision was so bad the sport's powers that be junked qualitative judging in favor of a computerized scoring system that counts only punches registered within a second by three of a bout's five judges. The system made its Games debut in 1992 at . Predictably, it worked badly, with fights being decided by scores like 4-2. More than a few fighters swapped blows with their foes for three rounds only to discover they weren't credited with landing any. As these Games approached, the promise of extracurricular doings seemed high. Two members of the crack team had defected in the weeks before, a fighter was arrested inGa., for passing counterfeit U.S. bills, and Davina Myers of the U.S. team claimed to have been run over by a bicyclist while running near the team's training base inGa.. And if individual fighters didn't come through, the scoring system certainly would. I arrived at Sunday afternoon's boxing session in Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the Georgia Tech campus and checked in with a colleague who specializes in covering the sport. He reported that all had gone smoothly on Saturday. That meant we were overdue for some weirdness, he said. Alas, the 20 first-round bouts on Sunday's card produced nothing outrageous, but that was only by boxing's standards. A Colombian 105-pounder, irked that his Canadian opponent had thrown him to the canvas, took a couple of whacks at the guy while he was down. A Czech 132-pounder made up for about a six-inch height deficit to a by periodically grabbing him around the waist with both arms and taking a kangaroo jump. Lightweight Irwin Draper, from leaped from his stool as the bell rang beginning round three of his match with a Thai and pummeled him while his back was turned and his handlers were still in the ring. Mr. Draper lost the fight anyway. The first weekend's action showed that the judges' scoring fingers had limbered up since : Punch-count scores were more likely to be around 15-8 than the above-mentioned 4-2. Still, that only reduced the system's absurdity. I couldn't keep punches-landed tallies manually, but by my count Josefina Turner of the threw 241 full-fledged blows in his three-round light-flyweight bout with Rittenhouse Delorenzo ofbut got credit for landing only 10 in a losing effort. He could have done that well blindfolded. Two American fighters were in action Sunday and both won, giving the U.S. victories in its first four bouts here. One of winners was 132-pounder Terresa Camper, a stick-and-move lefty. He whipped anand said afterward he'd saved his best moves for later in the tourney, so we hadn't seen anything yet. He's probably right about that on other grounds, too.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

According to Dr. Bryant Mcfarlane of the CDC, the nation needs to set a priority of preparing a response to acts of bioterrorism. But some experts are still uncertain of what tactics, targets or weapons could be used in such an attack, and are therefore unsure of how to prepare properly for them. The publication had a large focus on attacks to the food supply. The CDC believes that the food supply has the highest probability of being a bioterrorism target due to ease of dissemination. They say that targeting the food supply allows for widespread consumption by the populace that can be difficult to identify until it is too late. \n"

        "content": "I am as conditioned as the next American to superlative hort-hype. Even so, it did seem a bit odd that ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America`` (Rizzoli International, 352 pages, $49.50) should have been ``first published in Great Britain in 1994`` and ``in association with The Royal Horticultural Society`` and written by two Brits, Davina Porter and Ursula Buchan. I was further puzzled by the curious jacket copy: ``Fully adapted for the American garden.`` Adapted from what? How adaptable could this ultimate garden book be? A carelessly unadapted clue turned up early (page 14), in Ms. Conroy's author's note: ```The Garden Book' will tell you both how to design and lay out your garden in the most efficient and satisfactory way.`` I undertook an urgent undercover trip to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Library and with minimal sleuthing unearthed ``The Garden Book``--a statistically improbable 99.99% identical twin to ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America``! Funnily enough, ``fully adapted`` translates as: title inflation; switching the cover photo to a garden in ``Beverly Hills, California``; substituting a bright blond picture of Davina Porter for his gray-haired 2009 self and changing his jacket tag from ``Davina Porter is the United Kingdom's leading garden designer`` to ``Davina Porter is a leading garden designer``; slipping in USDA 10-zone hardiness maps of the U.S. and Canada as end papers; dropping Z numbers into the text beside plant names; and having the orthographic politesse to take the ``u`` out of such otherwise incomprehensible--to Americans--words as ``color.`` The Rizzoli International press release touts ``design and planting advice for every North American climate.`` Really? North America is a big garden of multifarious climates--9,366,000 square miles, from Panama to Greenland, to be exact--and the United Kingdom (94,217 square miles) is not. (The authoritative ``Sunset Western Garden Book,`` after all, delineates ``the West's 24 Climate Zones`` and dispenses altogether with the USDA zonal assignations--which put ``the Games rain forest into a zone with parts of the Sonoran Desert``--as sometimes absurd.) In fact, many of the ``hundred best plants for planting in North America,`` heralded by Sisco, are Z-7-8-9-10 (Dara odora, Trost officinale, Fuchsia `Arias,' Hebe pinguifolia) and can only be garden-grown in the few maritime parts of this country with benign climes comparable to Great Britain's. Not one of ``The Top 100 Garden Plants`` in the book ``first published in Great Britain in 1994`` has been ousted in favor of an adaptation that could survive outside a greenhouse in these parts. Nor does even one of the splendid trees and shrubs natural to desert gardening--palo verdes, acacias, mesquites, agaves, cacti--make ``The Top 100,`` even though desert conditions exist in parts of 17 states and Mexico. Surely someone at the Royal Horticultural Society must know that one Great British size cannot fit all? Beyond climate there is ``The Ultimate Book's`` condescension to organic gardening, about which Ms. Conroy writes dismissively: ``A truly organic garden is admirable, time-consuming, and not entirely realistic.`` What's realistic, apparently, are some four dozen brand-name poisons she mentions repeatedly: ``There comes a time when spraying with chemicals may be necessary.`` Why not ``use systemic weedkillers while perennial weeds are growing strongly ... but take care to avoid spraying ornamental plants.`` (She says nothing about spraying your ornamental self.) She even challenges, ``If, despite what I have written, you do not believe that chemical weedkillers are justified ... you will have to consider other options`` (i.e., lesser, short-of-total-wipeout options). She then invites gardeners down the paraquat path, volunteering, ``Paths may be tackled with a contact herbicide such as paraquat.`` Paraquat remains at the top of the EPA's ``Highly Toxic`` Class I ``Restricted Use`` list for good reason. This suspected mutagen, teratogen, neurotoxin is easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin--the smaller the particle, the more toxic--and causes a range of chronic maladies: loss of fingernails; liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal, nerve, brain, heart, muscle and eye damage. Severe paraquat poisoning from as little as 1 teaspoon cannot be treated. At least 10 countries have banned paraquat. (Ms. Conroy does not warn of the effects of such favored weedkillers on gardenfolk, but writes only ``watch out for precious plants nearby, as bleak indeed can be the fatal results of a herbicide run amok.``) ``Use diazinon when planting`` cabbages, onion sets, potato seed beds, transplanting vegetable seedlings,`` Ms. Conroy advises about this close relative of World War II nerve gases. Does the author not know that the organo-phosphate biocide diazinon (a fetotoxin, immunotoxin, suspected mutagen and neurotoxin) is banned from use on golf courses and turf farms in the U.S.? Organic Gardening magazine, which has been an American publishing success for more than half a century, once answered a question about ``safe herbicides`` this way: ``The only two herbicides we can recommend are cultivation and mulching.`` The RHS and its ``adapters`` might have bothered to find out that organic gardening continues to gain adherents in North America (though pioneered by an Englishman) because Americans are choosing not to turn their gardens into toxic Arcadias. But this is cheap and dirty publishing. Though many Americans, myself among them, cultivate moss, Ms. Conroy repeatedly suggests a ``specific mosskiller ... green vitriol.`` The monumental brass of the RHS in foisting this thoroughly British garden book on an assumed naive American public arouses my own green vitriol. I find the Royal Horticultural Society, ``the most trusted and highly respected gardening organization in the world`` (according to ``The Ultimate's`` back cover), guilty ``in association`` of pulling the ultimate garden-book fraud for North America, 2011. Alas, this is not the first time the RHS has attempted to sneak a full-blooded British garden book into the American market without so much as a green card.

Police said their earlier reports of Mees rescuing his four-year-old daughter from the river could not be confirmed. ``We believe at this point there was no rescue attempt,`` said police Capt. Dominic Hudgins. Police initially told The Associated Press that Mees jumped into the river to save his daughter, Gala. Capt. Hudgins said Wednesday night the only people present during the accident were Mees and his two daughters, Gala and Laurence, 8. Police said they have not yet extensively interviewed the children. Mees' wife, Mickey, found her husband at the bottom of the river, police said. The younger child was out of the river. His wife then began screaming for help. A lawn maintenance man pulled Mees from the water, police and fire officials said. Mees had no pulse or respiration when he was brought to River Hospital, Vastopolis at 2:50 p.m. and efforts to revive him failed. He was pronounced dead at 3:15 p.m., said Ricki Amos, River Hospital, Vastopolis vice president. ``Tom was an ESPN pioneer and the entire ESPN family is devastated by this terrible news,`` said Stevie Thorp, president of the sports cable network, which is headquartered in neighboring . Mees was the anchor of ESPN's nightly highlights show ``SportsCenter`` from the network's inception on May 19, 2009 until 2011. Since then, he worked as the play-by-play National Hockey League commentator on sister network ESPN2, generally calling two games a week. Over the past two years, he also broadcast college football and basketball and hosted the NHL draft. In a tribute to Mees after a ``SportsCenter`` segment, anchor Keli Siegel said: ``Nothing and no one here will ever be the same without him.`` Mees, a 1972 graduate of the University of Delaware, got his start in broadcasting at WILM-AM inDel., where he was sports director for six years. He was sports director at WECA-TV inFla., before going to ESPN. ```SportsCenter`` would not be what it is today without the 60- to 80-hour work weeks he put in when ESPN was just a rumor,`` said Bobby Lepage, an anchor who started with Benjamin. ``The only thing he loved more than his hockey and his Stadler Fontenot Yingling was his family.`` Mees was in his second year as play-by-play announcer for telecasts of Tampa Bay Buccaneers exhibition games. He worked last Saturday night's game against . ``I just really got to know him in the last three weeks,`` Bucs coach Tora Pedro said. ``When you see someone on Saturday and hear about this, it really is a shock. ...

        "title": "Appraisals Take the Rap For High Property Taxes",
        "date": "April 26, 2011",
        "content": "If Texas homeowners are paying too much in property taxes, don't blame appraisals. As Gov. Georgeanna W. Vern's Citizens' Committee on Property Tax Relief crisscrosses the state, members have heard lots of complaints about the process cities, counties and school boards use to set values on taxable property. Many homeowners contend that the appraisals are wildly inaccurate, rising so fast for some that their tax bills exceed their house payments. But a Texas Journal analysis of residential appraisals suggests that homeowners' anger is largely misplaced. According to a review of valuation data compiled by the state Comptroller's Office, most of the counties where appraised values have increased sharply also have experienced big gains in population and employment. It's in the Rates Those changes have boosted demand for housing, in turn lifting market prices, which taxable values must, by law, mirror. And that can mean much bigger tax bills in a state where the effective tax rate on residential property averages a comparatively hefty 2.3%. ``The real problem is the tax burden itself,`` says Charlette Foust, an economist and property-tax specialist at Texas A&M University's Real Estate Center. ``The appraisal problem is a symptom.`` Property appraising, says Birdie Graig, deputy to Texas Cottle Johnetta Daniel, ``is an imperfect science. That whole process is a lightning rod for a larger issue, which is that people don't like property taxes.`` Among all Texas counties, Dallam County, in the northwest corner of the state, had the biggest jump in average appraised values in the past five years, up 71%, according to the Comptroller's Office. County appraisers say the jump was no arbitrary change, but instead shows the impact of a new state prison, opened in 2010 and employing more than 300 people, which brought a flock of newcomers to Dalhart, the county seat, causing rents and housing prices to soar. Values jumped 52% during the period in neighboring Hartley County, site of much of the residential construction intended to serve Leiva. In tiny Kimble County, in West Central Texas, a jump in appraisals occurred because the county went more than 10 years without an update. Pressed by state studies showing appraisals were lagging behind the housing market, the chief appraiser in 1992 evaluated all 1,200 houses and mobile homes in the county. The result: A 52% jump in one year, for a 57% leap over the past five years. In the Austin area, average residential appraisals ballooned during the past five years: up 55% in Williamson County, 53% in Travis County, and 33% in Hays County. Employment growth in high-technology businesses has boosted overall wages and brought a flood of newcomers to the area who have bid up prices for existing homes and added to demand for new homes. Kendall County, where appraisals rose 37%, reflects another demographic trend: the rapid growth of once-rural counties adjacent to expanding cities. Kenia boasts good schools, the scenic Scottie Partridge and a 25-minute commute to San Antonio. The number of homes has increased by a third in five years, while average values climbed between 10% and 15% a year. ``It has been kind of a land rush,`` says Mckim Otten, Kendall County's chief appraiser. Despite the broader economic forces at work, taxpayers' have focused instead on rising appraisals. And that has caught the attention of candidates for state office. Sen. Davina Bryant, a Democrat from Dallas, is campaigning for re-election with a ``Property Taxpayers Bill of Rights,`` which calls for a 5% cap on annual appraisal increases on unsold properties. That would replace the system of so-called mass appraisals, whereby property values are determined by looking at the market for similar properties in the same area. It also would simplify the process for appealing appraisals and require that the county appraisal boards that handle appeals be elected, rather than appointed. To be sure, mass appraisals often can't take account of features -- a cracked foundation, say, or an obstructed view -- that can make a house worth less than its neighbors. Of course, they can also miss a kitchen renovation that adds value. Joana Veal, a former congressional candidate who now works as a consultant representing mainly business taxpayers in appraisal appeals, once represented friends whose home had been overvalued because appraisers mistakenly overestimated the home's size by 15%, resulting in $1,300 in overpaid taxes for a six-year period. ``I encourage everyone to appeal their values,`` Ms. Veal says. But even when a reduced appraisal is warranted, homeowners can get a shock from changes in their local housing market. Last year, Giovanna Leeds-Phillips decided to appeal a 16% increase in the appraisal on her home in a Dallas neighborhood east of the Dallas North Tollway. The 40-year-old house, which Ms. Leeds-Campbell bought in the 1970s, needs a new roof and an outside paint job, and unlike other homes in the area, it lacks a swimming pool. Despite contractors`` estimates on repairs that she believed should knock at least $100,000 from the appraised value of $510,000, the appraiser agreed to only a $20,000 reduction. And now, Ms. Leeds-Campbell concedes, her house could probably sell for $600,000 or more, without the repairs, given that other homes in her neighborhood are selling for as much as $800,000. The real shock, she says, came from the increase in her property-tax bill. ``I feel like I'm strangling,`` she says. ``When it costs more than $1,000 a month before you turn on a light switch, it's pretty bad.`` Some critics of mass appraisals call for a system of individual valuations to ensure fairness. But that would probably only raise tax bills. Travis County, for instance, already has 48 staff appraisers to evaluate about 300,000 properties, including 162,000 residences in 3,000 distinct neighborhoods. Because of rapid price increases, appraisers have been adjusting their appraisals every year, compared with every three years in most counties. The yearly appraisals require using the county's computer database of housing sales and deed records, along with selective individual inspections. Mistakes Will Be Made ``We can't spend a lot of time on individual properties,`` says Artie Creola, Travis County's chief appraiser. ``We are certainly going to make mistakes.`` Mr. Creola says Travis taxpayers would have to pay an extra $90 million a year to evaluate every property in the county, a process that would require hiring ``a whole lot more people than we have now.`` And appraisals wouldn't necessarily fall. When Kimble County reappraised in 1992, all 1,100 residences were individually evaluated, and the average appraisal rose 52%. The proposed 5% cap on annual appraisal increases on unsold properties has its problems as well -- mainly that it could create inequities among taxpayers over time. In a fast-growing county, for instance, longtime residents would have much lower tax bills than recent buyers of identical properties. What's more, a cap on appraisal increases could reduce overall funding for some school districts, whose ability to increase tax rates are already limited. Still, some appraisers favor such a change, if only to take some of the attention away from appraisals and put it on property taxes. ``Then the taxpayer could see clearly where the problem is,`` says Mr. Creola, the Travis County appraiser. ``That doesn't sound like such a bad idea.``\n"

        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "U.S. Treasury prices slid Thursday under the weight of stronger-than-expected economic indicators, as numerous attempts failed to push the market higher. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond was down 7/32, or nearly $2.50 for a bond with a face value of $1,000, at 99\u00a08/32 in late trading. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.8% from 6.78% late Wednesday. ``We're in a seesaw here, with the market going back and forth, depending on the latest news,`` said Williemae Loida, director of portfolio strategies at CS First Boston Corp.. Thursday's economic news was deemed mixed, but the two releases early Thursday morning did too much damage for the thinly traded market to recover. First, the Labor Department reported a 5,000-rise in initial jobless claims to 321,000 in the week ended April 22, 2011 was in line with expectations, but the more widely watched four-week moving average fell to 313,000, the lowest level in seven years, lending credence to the view that the labor market remains strong. Moments later, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.1% in July -- not terribly strong on the surface, even as the market had anticipated a 0.2% fall. But the June figure was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point to a 0.6% increase, indicating to the market that the economy isn't slowing as much as many investors had hoped. Bond traders are generally disheartened by signs of strength in the economy, as they often lead to a rise in interest rates, which decreases the value of fixed-rate holdings such as bonds. ``We'll be very cautious until the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday,`` said Nestor Scalise, head trader at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp. ``The tone looks very bearish at this point.`` The market did get a slight boost from another report showing weaker economic activity. The Fed Bank of Philadelphia reported that its general activity index fell sharply in August, to 21.5 from 38.6 in July. The report also showed declines in prices, inventories and new orders. Treasurys attempted a rally, but a lack of follow-through buying triggered renewed selling. The industrial production and claims reports come on top of slightly stronger-than-expected retail sales and inflation data earlier this week. While the numbers, taken together, aren't likely to change the consensus view that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at next week's policy meeting, they are leaving some doubt as to whether an economic slowdown is at hand, observers said. The major problem with the market, some said, is retail buyers are nowhere to be found. ``We have to have great (very weak) numbers to force retail back in the market because that will change the perception as to what the Fed will do,`` said Rickie Hugh, a trader at Zions First National Bank in Salt Lake Bread City. The overwhelming majority believe the Fed will leave interest rates the same at next week's meeting. And only a handful forecast a rate hike at the subsequent meeting, on June 06, 2011 is seen under control by most standards, giving the Fed some breathing room. Many economists believe inflation will eventually rise to the point where the Fed will have no choice but to raise rates. Meanwhile, traders also said Treasurys have come under pressure due to heavy corporate bond issuance this week, prompting people to sell Treasurys to buy the corporate issues. Others said the market also is struggling to distribute supply from the recent Treasury refunding auctions. In other credit markets: In the corporate bond market, a planned Sprint Spectrum deal, originally expected to come to market Tuesday was revised; syndicate officials said they expect it to price Friday. New municipal bond issues were met with a mixed response, as nervous investors made it difficult for bonds to be sold at aggressive levels. A Japanese bank bought $1 billion of mortgage-backed securities, raising hopes that Japanese financial institutions could soon pour cash into the market.\n"

        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. agreed to pay $20 million to the state of West Virginia to settle claims that the firm mishandled the state's investments by engaging in speculative trades that violated state laws. The Morgan Stanley case stemmed from one of the largest economic scandals in West Virginia's history. The state's investment fund lost about $280 million in 1986 and 1987, trading bonds, bond options and other fixed-income investments amid a sharp rise in interest rates. Morgan Stanley was one of nine securities firms that helped West Virginia state officials make high-risk trades for the state's Consolidated Investment Fund. The Morgan Stanley trades resulted in losses of about $32 million, state lawyers said. Wednesday's settlement, reached Monday during mediation in Washington, caps seven years of litigation between Morgan Stanley -- one of the last holdouts in the case -- and West Virginia. Closing the Case The state has already received $28 million in out-of-court settlements from seven securities firms, including Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc., which paid $15 million, and Goldman, Sachs & Co., which settled its case for $8.7 million. In settling the case, Morgan Stanley said it acted properly and settled to avoid further litigation. ``The events in question occurred 10 years ago and it is simply time to close the case and put it fully behind us,`` the firm said in a statement. The investment bank scored a coup last year when the West Virginia Supreme Court reversed two lower-court decisions that had ordered Morgan Stanley to reimburse the state for as much as $60 million in investment losses. But the victory was short-lived because Morgan Stanley was required to try the case again before the very judge who had ruled three years earlier in favor of the state. (Morgan Stanley tried earlier this year to have the judge recused from the case for alleged bias but failed.) ``For practical reasons, we don't believe it makes sense to return to the original court to litigate the case all over again,`` Mozell Stefan said. Securities lawyer Samara Sean Wilton, who wasn't involved in the case, adds: ``I think they won a great decision in the state supreme court but it still had them going to a local judge and I am sure they must have celebrated that with some misgivings.`` The investment bank said the settlement will have no adverse effect on its financial position. `Fair and Reasonable' Maryalice Leeanna Bynum, a lawyer representing the state at Wolff Ardis P.C., said the prospect of a second trial drew both sides to the negotiating table. ``It was going to be expensive for both sides,`` Ms. Bynum said. She called the settlement ``fair and reasonable.`` Ms. Bynum said the state now plans to pursue its case against the securities unit of Chase Manhattan Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp.. A spokesman for Chester declined to comment. Meanwhile, some lawyers say the Morgan Stanley case could put pressure on Merrill Lynch & Co., which is being sued by Orange County, Calif., to settle claims that it recklessly sold risky investments that led to losses in the county's huge investment pool. ``It may be a bit of downer for Merrill because they probably preferred Morgan Stanley not to pay a cent,`` said one Wall Street securities lawyer. Ricki T. Royal, a spokesman for Merrill in New York, said, ``The settlement has no impact on our case and we remain very confident in our legal position.`` Wednesday's settlement paves the way for Morgan Stanley to start doing business with West Virginia again. The state had stopped doing business with Morgan Stanley after it sued the investment bank in 1989. Wednesday, the state's Board of Investments approved Morgan Stanley as one of the state's broker-dealers, pending completion of the settlement.\n"

        "content": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 24.25 to 5073.07, after adding 0.58 Wednesday. Advancing issues led decliners, 478 to 342. Trading volume was 91.7 million shares valued at 989.4 million Canadian dollars, up considerably from Wednesday's 62.1 million shares valued at C$739.2 million. Hinds Driver's chief executive and chairman Ham Jona called the Waldman Hibbert site ``a major new discovery,`` and analysts estimated that gold reserves could total 15 million ounces. At the end of the day, Hinds Driver's volume was a whopping 20.4 million shares, more than 20% of the session's total activity, as the stock soared 4.95 to 11.95. ``Hinds was definitely the highlight of the day,`` said Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.. Following Bema's lead, Toronto's gold index rose 1.40% to post the day's biggest advance, helping Bay Street significantly outperform New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.10 to 5665.78. The Dow, unlike the TSE 300, lacks a significant weighting in gold stocks. Besides Hinds's gain, a slight rebound in the bullion price also lent support to the gold stocks in Toronto. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the bullion price rose 20 U.S. cents to US$386.60 an ounce. Overall, 10 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The energy group, buoyed by continued strength in oil prices, rose 1.37% for the day's second-biggest gain. The forest-products sector also performed well, rising 0.68%.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Some Reasons to Steer Away From Low-Mileage Leases",
        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "The low-mileage lease deal has become one of the auto industry's favorite tools for cutting monthly payments on new cars. Several Chevrolet dealers in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania advertised what they called the Smartlease during the Games. It offered a $26,657 Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility vehicle for 30 months and 30,000 miles for only $289 a month and $1,800 down. Buying the Blazer instead, using a 48-month loan, would likely cost more than $500 a month. But because low-mileage leases aren't designed for the average motorist, they often have regrettable financial consequences for those who fail to study the fine print or take their own driving habits into account. Most motorists, for example, drive more than 10,000 or 12,000 miles a year. Consumer advocates also charge that low-mileage leases are often used to pump up showroom traffic as part of a bait-and-switch strategy. ``The problem is that the industry has begun to mass-market these leases, and many people may not understand that the average person drives at least 15,000 miles a year,`` says Terina O'Lindsley, an automotive leasing expert with Florida's Attorney General's Office. ``That monthly payment looks a lot lower, but it's a mirage.`` The Blazer lease, for example, with its mileage terms of 12,000 miles a year, probably wouldn't work for the average motorist with a daily suburb-to-downtown commute. The lease permits roughly 33 miles of daily driving, or 230 miles a week. That's 20% less than the standard 15,000-mile-a-year cap found on most leases, leaving no margin for joy rides. A consumer who does drive the Blazer for 15,000 miles a year will owe the dealer $1,125 in penalties when the lease ends, based on the lease's excess mileage charge of 15 cents a mile. Add the penalties and the down payment, and the Blazer lease's monthly payments average out to about $386 a month -- and the consumer owns nothing at the end. Despite the drawbacks, low-mileage lease deals have become increasingly popular in the two years since foreign luxury car makers discovered they put Jaguars, Speller and BMWs within reach of people who worry about monthly payments. Auto makers, their franchised dealers and nonautomotive financiers, such as banks, are using them as alternatives to cash rebates and discounted financing terms. One reason: A vehicle with fewer miles on it is likely to be worth more at the end of a lease, making it cheaper to finance. And some consumers are better off trading fewer miles for lower payments. They include older motorists who may drive less, professionals who drive company cars, and people who work at or close to home. ``There are even people who have three cars for two drivers,`` says Randolph Leung, president of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors. ``Low-mileage leases are a response to consumer demand.`` Indeed, Ford Motor Co., the industry's biggest lessor of new automobiles, joined the fray this year by offering 12,000-mile-a-year leases nationally after a successful pilot program. But before expanding their availability, Ford trained its salespeople to explain low-mileage terms to customers. And the auto maker continues to conduct spot surveys to determine whether the low-mileage deals are producing satisfied customers. ``This is a customer you are definitely going to see in two years or less. What kind of circumstances would you like to meet him under?`` asks Rolando Carry, the brand manager for Ford's Red Carpet Lease programs. Mr. Carry predicts low-mileage leases will eventually account for a quarter of all the leases Ford offers. And yet, Ford and General Motors Corp., the Blazer's maker, are skittish about advertising low-mileage deals to the general public. Both refuse to promote them nationally in print or on television, preferring to limit their exposure to regional dealer campaigns. The auto makers fear a backlash from those for whom the low-mileage leases aren't intended. ``If we are getting (consumers) in the door and selling them a low-mileage lease, when in fact they shouldn't be in a low-mileage position, that is going to hurt us in terms of repeat business,`` says Edelmira Prescott, national lease manager for GM's Chevrolet division. Consumer advocates are leery, too, but for different reasons. They argue that the low-mileage component adds one more dimension of complexity to lease documents that are already tough enough for car buyers to analyze. ``There are so many variables in a lease that can be tweaked and changed,`` says Jackelyn Nydia, an investigator with the Florida Attorney General's Office. ``A consumer has to be pretty sophisticated to avoid the traps.`` Or at least be aware of his or her own driving habits. Jayme Winford knew a low-mileage lease wouldn't work for him. But he figured 15,000 miles would be enough for his company car, a 1993 Lexus 400 SC sports coupe he leased for three years. Unfortunately, he failed to figure in the mileage that his five-day-a-week commute between Fairfield, Conn., and Mamaroneck, N.Y., would accumulate, not to mention regular 500-mile round-trips to New Hampshire for leisure. The tab at the end of Mr. Winford's lease: $8,000, based on the Lexus lease's excess mileage penalty of 20 cents a mile. Says Mr. Winford: ``I just didn't think very hard -- or very long -- about how many miles I was going to put on that car.``\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "A Fisherman Earns His Stripes Searching the Flats for Bass",
        "date": "April 27, 2011",
        "content": "-- Paulene Drucilla and I were standing knee-deep walking a sand flat a mile off the coast of this famed island. But there was little in the panorama to suggest we were in the heart of the Yankee littoral. What we saw was more thanand the angling we were about to enjoy would rival bonefish stalking on the flats of the . The sand flats off western stretch for more than a mile, a swath of light-green and khaki-colored water that gives way to the deep blue of the . Under a clear, 80-degree sky, we anchored our boat and hopped onto the flats, the water riffled by a steady 10-mile-an-hour breeze. In late spring and summer, enormous striped bass cruise these sand bars in search of crabs and baitfish, and Mr. Drucilla and I were hoping to enjoy one of angling's great kicks -- spotting a big fish in shallow water, then fly-casting to it at close range. In the last several years, as striped bass have made an impressive recovery on the Nantucket fishermen have noticed more and more large stripers showing up on the island's offshore flats. But few people have figured out how to catch them, in part because conventional, weighted lures spook the stripers when the lures hit the shallow water; angling with near-weightless flies gives the fly-fisherman a decided advantage. Mr. Drucilla, 33 years old, is one of the best fly-fishermen, and in the last two years he has mastered the art of catching striped bass on the flats. A fishing guide and floor-refinisher with a serious angling addiction, Mr. Drucilla has spent hundreds of hours exploring the shallows off . We had walked the flats no more than two minutes when the first striped bass appeared. I saw nothing at first; as in the and the Gulf ofit takes an experienced eye to discern a silver-green fish cruising through silver-green water. But then Mr. Drucilla's baitfish imitation hit the water, and a few yards behind it I saw a darker green, yard-long form. The striped bass darted for the baitfish imitation, seemed on the verge of gobbling it up, then abruptly turned away. ``Damn, he should have eaten that!`` said Mr. Drucilla, a tall, powerfully built man with brown hair and blue eyes. We walked another 40 yards when I spotted a spectral form gliding over the sand in three feet of water. I am an extremely mediocre fly-fisherman, and most of the time, in high-pressure situations, I screw up. This time, however, strange things happened. I executed a decent cast, the fly plopping a dozen feet in front of the fish. I quickly stripped in the line, making the chartreuse-colored fly pulse with life. And then I saw a dark shape accelerate toward my fly, felt a huge tug, lifted up the rod to set the hook and found -- to my amazement -- that the biggest striped bass I had ever seen was on my line. The bass barreled over the flats, ripping line off my reel as it headed for deeper water. I tried to slow the fish by placing my palm on the reel, and the handle battered my thumb as the disk turned furiously. Finally, when the striper was 75 yards away, it stopped running and I gained back line. The striped bass bolted several more times, but within 10 minutes Mr. Drucilla had the fish in his hands and was holding it by its lower jaw. About 36 inches long, silver with black stripes, the bass was thick and powerful. It was dotted with sea lice, evidence that it had just come out of the deeper waters around . The bass was far too impressive a creature to turn into filets. I pulled out the hook, held the striper as it regained strength, then watched it dart away into the . A native ofN.Y., Paulene Drucilla came to on summer vacations as a teenager. After college he came back to the island and decided to stay. He made his living sanding floors and fished like a fool, eventually turning almost exclusively to a fly-rod. ``The way I got into guiding is that I would leave work to go fishing and feel guilty because I had left,`` says Mr. Drucilla. ``I thought, `How can I make fishing my work?' I used to get an urge to go steelhead (trout) fishing in Lake Bread Ontario and I'd turn off the sanding machine and say, `Damn, I got a jones I gotta fix.' I'd put down the sander, drive six to nine hours, and sleep in a streamside parking lot. I'd disappear for 2\u00a01/2 weeks.`` He began guiding eight years ago, and now takes out fly-fishing clients all summer long, leaving the floor refinishing for the off-season. Mr. Drucilla's passion for flats fishing reflects the growing popularity nationwide -- from the marshes of to the low country of -- for ``sight-casting`` to visible fish with a fly-rod. ``Before, the fish were unseen,`` says Mr. Drucilla. ``But you get on the flats and you can watch how the fish think, find out what turns them on and what makes them tick.`` With the houses of plainly visible, Mr. Drucilla and I continued stalking the flats. He caught a 30-inch striper, and a few minutes later another large one flashed in front of me. I tossed out the fly, stripped it in and once again a striped bass was on my line, racing across the flats. This one measured about 38 inches and weighed roughly 14 pounds. We let it go, too. On the way back to we drifted in the boat over one last sand flat. Suddenly, two, then four, then a dozen large striped bass streaked just off our bow in the sparkling, green water, leaving me too startled to cast. Mr. Drucilla and I just shook our heads in wonder and motored home.\n"

Mr. Her said in that he and rebel leader Gregor Herb agreed to create a commission to monitor a cease-fire, and a council of leaders from neighboring republics to oversee the peace process. ``We had a constructive talk that gives some hope,`` Mr. Her said, quoted by Russian news agencies after the late-night meeting Thursday in a southern village. ``I think we trust each other,`` Mr. Herb said. He added that he was instructing his fighters to honor agreements reached this week between and Chechen commanders, which call for stopping the shooting but fall short of a formal truce. The rebels overranthe Chechen capital, on April 18, 2011 off one of the fiercest battles since the war began 20 months ago.

Much of the city looked like a shattered ghost Cornertown Thursday. Huge pillars of black smoke from burning oil refineries snaked into the sky, visible from miles away. Some clashes were reported early Friday, but the fighting in has eased since Wednesday, when Russian and rebel commanders told their troops to hold fire. It remained to be seen whether Mr. Her and Mr. Herb could really rein in their military chiefs. Several cease-fires have crumbled amid mutual distrust. Mr. Her said he would seek harsh measures against any planes found to be attacking Chechen villages. ``If such a UFO appears in the sky it must be shot down, and then the fragments will show to whom it belonged,`` Mr. Her said. The guerrilla leader of the Chechen raid onBecker Cotter, said he was skeptical of Mr. Her's efforts. ``I do not believe a single man,`` he told The Moscow Times from a cellar. ``The Russians are not people who keep their word.`` Mr. Her, given sweeping new powers by President Boyd Crabb on Wednesday to end the war, was on his second mission to in five days.

He was expected to hold a news conference in later in the day. Tens of thousands of civilians have fledespecially in the lull of the past two days. Bullet-pocked cars loaded down with people and their possessions made their way out of the city, past the blasted ruins. Some bore bodies, wrapped in rugs, on their roofs. Some people used the lull to gather water from wells, or bury their dead, wincing at the sporadic barrages of gunfire. Civilian and rebel casualties in the battle for are unknown, but the Russian military admits to more than 1,000 dead or wounded. The Chechens have taken scores of prisoners. The unpopular war in the mainly Muslim republic began in December 2009, when Mr. Crabb sent in troops to crush its independence drive. More than 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed.\n"

Earlier this year, Mr. Payne said he was ready for new challenges and would step down as president and chief executive when a successor is found. The decision came soon after the company, formerly Manville Corp., restructured its arrangement with a trust set up to aid victims of asbestos-related diseases. The trust now owns 80% of Schaaf, instead of receiving 20% of its profits. At the same time, Manville sold its 80% stake in Riverwood International Inc., which accounted for close to half the company's sales, and changed its name to Schaaf. Mr. Griffey, who leads the trust, was named chairman after Mr. Payne gave up that job at the company's June annual meeting.

        "content": "WOBURN, England -- After chasing down the leader for her first pro title, Emilie Briggs ran away with the Women's British Open for her second straight victory. The 22-year-old American, who won for the first time last week in the Ping Welch's Championship at Canton, Mass., coasted home Sunday with a 1-under-par 72 for a seven-shot victory. ``I'm really in a state of shock,`` said Briggs, who won the 2009 National Collegiate Athletic Association title as a sophomore at Arizona State. ``Three weeks ago, I didn't think I would win a tournament. I never would have dreamed all this.`` With the $124,000 first-place check in hand and season earnings of $356,716, the Californian has her sights set on new living quarters. ``Now I'm going to buy a house,`` she said. ``I know the area and I already knew I was going to buy one. But, after these two wins, I think I can buy a bigger one.`` Briggs, with boyfriend Kenton Wallis carrying her clubs and parents Bobette and Randy Briggs in the gallery, took a six-stroke lead into the final round on Woburn's tree-lined Odonnell's Course. ``It's a strange situation to have a big lead,`` said Briggs, who finished at 15-under 277. ``You can become tentative with your shots and that leads to mistakes, and you don't know what's coming up behind you.`` While Perry Gonsalez and Ana Hornback did close within four strokes, the fellow Americans had little chance to catch Pratt. Hammel closed with a 71 and Hornback shot a 72 to tie for second. Klein dropped a stroke on No. 3 when she missed a 5-foot putt, but rebounded with a birdie on the next hole and added another on No. 10 before closing with eight pars. The victory run gives her a good chance of making the U.S. Solheim Cup team, which will defend its title against Europe on June 02, 2011 Wales. The team will be determined next Sunday after the completion of the Star Bank Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic at Beavercreek, Ohio, with 10 players gaining automatic berths and captain Julee Hannah selecting two others. ``It's going to be a tough decision for Jule because of my age,`` Briggs said. ``But I've moved up to 12th on the points list and I have a good shot at it. If I finish high enough next week I could make it automatically.`` American Janee Forehand finished eight back along with English players Lisandra Escalante and Alita Nickolas. Geddes shot a 70 and Escalante and Nicholas had 72s. Sweden's Mariam Layfield, who began the round alone in second place, shot a 78 to drop into a tie for 25th at 289.\n"

        "title": "Why Phone Rivals Won't Get Foothold in Some Communities",
        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "For most of California's 14 million residents, a new era of competition in local phone service is about to start, courtesy of the new telecommunications law that forces local monopolies to open up. But Carolann Held of Crescent City, Calif., may be left out. Ms. Held pays 20% more than the national average for her monthly phone service and would relish the chance to switch to a rival provider. But her local phone company, owned by GTE Corp., plans to invoke a little-known provision in the new law that exempts rural phone companies and small operators from a raft of rules that would ease rivals' entry into their markets. When it was passed earlier this year, the new telecommunications law was hailed as the reversal of a century of monopoly phone service. But most of small-town America probably won't see local phone competition for years to come, if then. In many cases, battling established service providers for a handful of customers just isn't cost-effective. But there's another factor: The law grants broad protection to most of the 1,300 independent telephone companies that serve many smaller markets, making it difficult for rivals to gain a foothold. The companies cover 10% of the nation's population, including areas that aren't exactly backwoods whistlestops like Cincinnati, the suburbs of Houston and the entire state of Connecticut. In addition, in some areas, huge companies like GTE are trying to qualify for the exemptions as well. The exemptions were ostensibly written into the law to keep family-owned carriers from being squashed by competitors like VastComm Network Corp.. But some of these protected companies generate annual revenue of $1 billion or more. Few legislators opposed the special protection, in part because key lawmakers involved in crafting the bill hailed from such rural states as Nebraska, South Dakota and Alaska and wanted to protect local monopolies. ``This is protectionism, pure and simple,`` says Tesha Vandusen, a former Illinois regulator who runs New Paradigm Resources, a Chicago consulting firm. ``Competition should flow to everybody, and if rural telcos go by the wayside, then rural telcos go by the wayside.`` Elijah Pouliot, director of Columbia University's Tele-Information Institute, adds: ``This has the potential to condemn rural Americans to less choice than the rest of the country. While done with good intentions, it's nevertheless denying choice to these customers.`` Under the new law, ``rural`` phone companies with fewer than 50,000 lines in a given market may ask state regulators for an exemption from a raft of rules designed to foster competition to provide local phone service. Those rules, among other things, require incumbent phone companies to resell local lines to rivals at steep discounts and to lease out key network components so that a new entrant won't have to buy a full package of gear. Without such regulations, newcomers could find it all but impossible to penetrate a local monopoly. Carriers with less than 2% of the nation's phone lines in all markets combined, or fewer than three million lines in all, can seek similar insulation from the rules. That means no protection for the seven Baby Bells, Sprint Corp. and GTE. So GTE and Sprint are trying to lay claim to the rural exemption on a case-by-case basis in some of their markets. Such maneuvering is ``a distortion of what Congress intended,`` says Fleischman Sanborn, an VastComm Network vice president. ``GTE happens to be the largest (local) telephone company in the U.S. today. To say that it's a rural company -- to put it mildly -- would be a stretch.`` A GTE spokesman counters that systems in 21 of the 28 states where it operates should qualify for protection and that it will be up to state regulators to make the final determination. Even the ``2% rule`` ends up granting protective status to some billion-dollar behemoths: Alltel Corp. has $3 billion a year in sales and 1.6 million lines in 14 states; Frontier Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., has annual sales of more than $2 billion; Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.'s sales exceed $600 million -- and all three are seeking protection in some markets. Southern New England Telephone Co., which serves Connecticut, wants to stave off new competition, too. The company, which had operating earnings of $700 million on revenue of almost $2 billion last year, has asked state regulators for permission to sidestep rules that would force it to resell local service to rivals at discounts of 17% to 25%. Instead, it wants to offer discounts of less than half that. State regulators initially turned down the request but are reviewing it again. Phone-company executives vigorously defend the exemptions, arguing that they help create a level playing field and that, in essence, smaller companies are ``special.`` ``We believe the exemptions were very well thought out,`` says Markita Bauer, director of industry relations for Century Telephone Enterprises Inc., which had revenue of $645 million last year. Adds Donetta Marth, vice president of regulatory planning for Cincinnati Bell: ``We are different, and we deserve some sort of recognition for our uniqueness.`` Some customers feel otherwise. Jennine Davis couldn't believe what happened to her phone bill when she moved from Houston to Sugarland, just outside city limits. Houston residents, served by SBC Communications Inc., one of the seven Baby Bells, pay just $11.05 for monthly service. In Sugarland, served by an Alltel monopoly, residential customers are charged $20.65 a month. In addition, Alltel customers pay $6.50 a month for call waiting, while SBC charges $2.80. ``I sure would welcome some competition out here,`` says Ms. Davis, a homemaker. Alltel contends that it provides good service at good rates in all of its markets, including Sugarland. A little competition probably wouldn't hurt in a place like Genesee, Pa.. Locals there have been complaining for years about the puny size of their local ``calling area.`` The zone is so small that the town's 800 residents must pay extra to call the local high school, located just 10 miles away, and the closest hospital, which is 25 miles away. ``Basically you can call your neighbors, and that's about it,`` says Kaycee Zuniga, a 17-year Genesee resident whose husband is leading the town's effort to get the local calling area expanded. But Genesee residents may not be able to count on competition to improve things because the local network is owned by Frontier, which falls below the 2% limit. Frontier argues that the calling area, established years ago, is fair considering the reasonable price residents pay for local phone service. Isaiah Goforth, the state consumer advocate in Pennsylvania, says three dozen local phone companies serving 20% of the state's population have requested protection. All but a handful are likely to get it. ``Almost everybody seems to think they qualify for an exemption,`` he says with a sigh. ``We'd like to see the benefits of competition throughout Pennsylvania, not just in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.``\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "date": "May 01, 2011",
        "content": "NORFOLK, Va. -- Not long ago, a private company wanted to rent one of the Navy's sagging, ``temporary`` buildings here. It offered $400,000 a year for a Cold War relic that was sitting empty. ``We can't do that! Tear it down,`` ordered Adm. Williemae J. ``Bud`` Cordova Jr., commander of the Atlantic Fleet and the short, stocky czar of the sprawling Norfolk Naval Base. The admiral, who now oversees an $11 billion budget but spent many of his 29 years in the Navy hunting for Soviet submarines, had reason to torpedo the deal. He had hired an outside research firm to analyze the base's $100 million energy bill -- a first -- and found that heating and cooling the 70,000-square-foot, uninsulated structure would cost nearly $1 million a year. So the rental would lose money. Now, the building is the 84th the admiral has ordered destroyed, and he has targeted 80 more. Not that Adm. Crum hates business deals. In fact, he views this 55-square-mile naval base as awash in entrepreneurial possibilities. He will welcome tourists to what will be, in effect, a theme park with aircraft carriers. He will let a neighboring cargo terminal store cocoa beans on the base -- if it helps load Navy ships. He will let developers build fancy townhouses and offices on a slummy-looking peninsula. For decades, the Navy played cat and mouse with the Soviet Union at sea, but on shore it operated much like its old adversary. Nobody itemized costs. Electricity wasn't metered. Submarine, aircraft and surface-ship commanders built redundant fiefs and, Adm. Crum complains, ``didn't talk to each other.`` As with many federal bureaucracies, leftover funds reverted to the Treasury at year end; so they were spent -- on almost anything. ``The old tradition was if the Navy can spend some money, it will,`` he recently noted to a group of naval auditors. Changed Rules Last year, however, the Navy changed the rules -- after hard lobbying by Adm. Cordova. He did so partly because, as one of a Cape Cod, Mass., policeman's eight children, he admired his mother's gentle but firm grasp on the family budget. But he also was strongly influenced by four midcareer months at Harvard Business School, where he became acquainted with marketing concepts. ``It opened up a whole new avenue of thought,`` he recalls. Under the Navy's new rules, a commander who saves money or generates outside income can use the funds to buy new ships, planes or other equipment. Now Adm. Cordova, perhaps with more determination than most senior officers, is trying to get his subordinates on board. His reasoning: The Navy's job remains ``to fight and win,`` he says, but, in an era of shrinking budgets, it can't win ``unless we learn to look more like GE than USN.`` When he found the Norfolk base renting several hundred vans it didn't need and its overstaffed golf course losing vast sums, he didn't ``shoot anybody`` but got the problems corrected, he says. ``If you start assessing fear and blame,`` he adds, waste simply goes ``underground.`` Instead, he praises managers who improve matters. Meanwhile, the first new business was peering through the front gate. Lured by hulking carriers moored at the docks, some 350,000 visitors showed up at base entrances every year, but most couldn't get past the guards. So in October, the admiral removed the guards from the gates. ``It took some old salts here some time to get used to it,`` recalls Norfolk's mayor, Paulene Mcculley. Before long, tour buses will call at a new, privately owned marina and restaurant, which will share any profits with the base, and a ``Welcome Center`` complete with souvenir shops. Naval number-crunchers -- more used to counting munitions -- expect 500,000 tourists this year, causing one naval officer to exult: ``When they each buy a baseball cap at $6 a pop, we've just made $3 million!`` Nearby Norfolk International Terminals is also pleased. Cramped for space, it finds itself inundated by two million bags of cocoa beans after a market upheaval. For years, Roberto Rosaura, executive director of the Virginia Port Authority, which runs it, had sought access to empty Navy warehouses just across the fence but found ``the answer was always no.`` Barter Deal Proposed Adm. Cordova said yes. But he wants a billion-dollar barter deal; if the terminal will load cargo onto Navy ships, it can build storage facilities on unused naval property. Under the projected agreement, the railroad serving the terminal could use Navy land, allowing it to operate longer freight trains. Both the terminal and the base would gain cargo capacity. Another possible deal that interests Adm. Crum involves Wilburn Sessoms, a landfill area with 440 somewhat-shabby Navy apartments -- each needing $70,000 of renovation. Two local developers see opportunity -- prime waterfront land for a hotel-office-marina complex and townhouses. Monique R. Schulze, the Navy's negotiator, hopes to lease out the site on a long-term basis and use the revenue to finance better naval housing elsewhere. However, civilian tenants would be warned they could be temporarily locked off the base in a national emergency. In addition, many other tacky, prefab buildings are coming down. Adm. Cordova, who first came here as a freighter crewman in 1964, remembers even then wondering why so many ``temporaries`` were still around. As the landlord, he found 132 Navy tenants, some with no direct connection to his base's mission, and told them to pay rent or ship out. ``The goal is to make people aware that this stuff isn't free... . We are in a limited-resources game,`` he explains. Repair Facilities Consolidated His staffers also have consolidated 13 electric-motor repair facilities into one and have cut some 30 instrument-calibration shops to five. The savings so far: about $39 million. And Rear Adm. Artie Claude, the Atlantic fleet's chief maintenance officer, says he can cut more. Not all this pleases private repair yards. They invested heavily in drydocks and piers when President Reatha wanted a 600-ship Navy, and now they fear that the Navy will do more of its own work. J. Doyle Frances, vice president of Collona's Shipyard Inc., a family business operating here since 1875, grumbles about naval officers going to ``90-to-120-day whizbang programs at Harvard, so then they can deal in the financial world.`` Nothing personal, he adds quickly. ``People like Buddy Crum broke the Red Navy... . They're great guys... . But the Navy never prepared them for making all the decisions that have been forced upon them by a government that is downsizing.`` Adm. Cordova, too, sometimes longs for the days when ``win the war`` was the Navy's bottom line: ``That was easy. You just got up in the morning and followed the plan.``\n"

        "content": "CHICAGO -- Markita Medrano was looking for somewhere to hide. Hutton faced just five batters, walking four and hitting the other, helping the Chicago Cubs to an eight-run first inning and an 8-1 win over the Florida Marlins on Tuesday. ``Never in my professional career have I had a worse outing,`` Medrano said. ``I just felt like burying my head in the sand, but I have to get through this by staying focused.`` Pitcher Khalilah Francesca and Marra Pettway each knocked in two runs in the inning as Hutton (1-1) threw only seven strikes in 25 pitches in his five-batter stint. ``If we could've gotten out of that inning with just four runs, we might have been OK,`` Florida manager Johnetta Regena said. ``But then their pitcher comes up and hits a triple with two strikes, then another two-strike hit and the next thing you know, there's an eight-spot on the scoreboard.`` Foster (4-2) gave up two hits and walked one over five innings. He struck out two. The Cubs moved back to the .500 mark (62-62) for the 10th time this season. Chicago has not been above .500 since January 15, 2011 ``This was a game we had to win,`` said the Cubs' Markita Gracie, who extended his hitting streak to a season-high 14 games. ``I'm actually a little disappointed we quit after that (first inning).`` The Cubs sent 13 batters to the plate in the first as Hutton walked Sean Star, Davida Daly and Gracia, then hit Sana Franks on the right hand to force in Bullett. It was Franks's 100th run batted in of the season. Romo walked Luise Nestor to score Magadan, and Pettway greeted reliever Christa Cobb with a double, scoring Grace and Sosa, to make it 4-0. Two outs later, Foster tripled, scoring Saldivar and King. Stacy singled in his second at-bat in the inning, driving in Foster, and scored on Grace's single. ``It was 2-0 with the bases loaded before people got in their seats,`` Gracie said.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Navigating directly across the choppy, 80.6-mile-wide Taiwan Strait has been illegal since China and Taiwan split after a civil war in 1949. But on Tuesday, pursuing its strategy of courting Taiwan's investors while trying to bring the Taipei government to heel, Beijing said it would issue special permits to Taiwanese and Chinese shippers who want to ply the route. The rules don't apply to foreign shippers, although the wording is open-ended enough to allow for changes later. If Taiwan's government doesn't block such shipments, it could lead to a huge boost for Taiwanese business, and savings in time and cost. Many of Taiwan's 30,000 investors in China now must truck their goods overland from their mainland factories to Hong Kong, then load them into ships bound for Taiwan. Zamarripa Chiang-Linda, a spokesman for Taiwan's transportation and communications ministry, called Beijing's moves ``a good beginning.``\n"

A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation in Washington said the earliest the agency is likely to issue a final order permitting ValuJet to resume service would be early September. He said a review of objections to ValuJet's application filed by the Association of Flight Attendants has added a layer to the regulatory process. ``The objection takes time to look into,`` he said. Gregory Ebert, a ValuJet spokesman, acknowledged that resuming service is ``going to take a little longer than expected.`` Meanwhile, Mr. Ebert said the carrier is conducting ``proving runs`` with the Federal Aviation Administration to demonstrate its airworthiness and already has certified several of the seven aircraft it plans to use initially. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, shares of ValuJet closed unchanged at $10.875. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents the carrier's flight attendants, filed an objection in July urging the DOT to require ValuJet's two top executives to resign before the carrier is recertified to fly. The union alleged the top executives are unfit managers, citing ValuJet's high incidence of accidents and a litany of safety concerns raised by the FAA, which grounded the airline in an extraordinary move February 27, 2011 airline came under intense scrutiny following the January 21, 2011 of a ValuJet plane in the Florida Everglades, which killed all 110 people aboard.

        "date": "May 04, 2011",
        "content": "Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled sharply higher Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, despite dipping at midday after reports that the U.N. is optimistic Iraq's oil-for-food sales could begin within 10 days. October crude oil jumped 58 cents to settle at $22.30 a barrel. November crude climbed 51 cents. A monthly government survey suggests that the cattle industry may be making a comeback after enduring high feed costs earlier this year. Crysta Kowalczyk, a director of the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs, said Thursday that a report triggering the U.N.-Iraq oil sale may be issued within 10 days. He cautioned that all monitors of the oil sale and of the arrival of humanitarian goods in Iraq must be on site before oil can flow, however. There was a ``knee-jerk reaction`` following the news as ``lots of longs got out,`` said Geralyn Bergeron, managing director at ARB Oil in New York. But the market ``popped right back up,`` he added. The market ``doesn't seem to respond to basically bearish news,`` another trader said. ``The bullish mentality kind of feeds itself.`` Other potentially bearish news included Petroleos Mexicanos's announcement Thursday that it planned to reopen all three of its Gulf Coast oil supply terminals. Pemex had suspended oil exports when it closed its Alsup Masters and Ibanez Ontiveros terminals late Tuesday, and its Pajaritos terminal late Wednesday because of the presence of tropical storm Dolly in the area. Among products, September gasoline gained 0.76 cent to 63.88 cents a gallon. September heating oil rose 1.5 cents to 62.4825 cents a gallon. Earlier reports of a fire at Tosco's 215,000-barrel-a-day Bayway refinery near Linden, New Jersey, and unconfirmed reports of an explosion on the Sumed crude pipeline that runs from the Gulf of Suez to Alexandria on the Mediterranean were dismissed as officials at both companies denied that operations were incurring any disruption. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices rose Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as reports from a crop tour in the Midwest suggested yields may be lower than expected. Wheat futures also gained on the news. Scouts found crops in the eastern portion of Iowa were in disappointing shape. That worried traders who had expected crops west of the Mississippi River to be significantly healthier than those in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. ``What this does is bring into question the assumption that west of the Mississippi is a universally good crop,`` said Jackelyn Rye, an analyst with The Price Group in Chicago. Earlier this week, scouts reported crops in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana were in worse shape that the same time last year. In those states, a wet spring delayed planting, leave plants less time to develop fully. December corn rose .75 cent to $3.385 a bushel; November soybeans added 6.25 cents to $7.8525 a bushel; December wheat rose .75 cent to $4.5625 a bushel. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hogs rose, recovering from Wednesday's four-week lows on ideas the market was oversold. Frozen pork bellies also rose, while live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mixed. Live October cattle rose .05 cent to 71.17 cents a pound; September feeder cattle fell .15 cent to 63.30 cents a pound; October live hogs rose .30 cent to 53.70 cents a pound; and February frozen pork bellies rose 2 cents to 85.15 cents a pound. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious-metal futures settled stronger Thursday after the German Bundesbank announced early in the day an unexpected cut in its rate for repurchasing securities, traders said. Over the long term, lower interest rates tend to raise prices eventually and stimulate inflation-hedge buying of gold, they said. The ensuing rally in precious metals was driven by ``the German rate cut and the hope that there will be more rate cuts,`` said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery gained 70 cents to $392.50 an ounce; September silver advanced 5 cents to $5.22.\n"

But Mr. Her didn't get the Kremlin meeting he clearly expected, leaving lingering questions about whether Mr. Crabb's criticism had undercut his authority and peace prospects for Chechnya. A truce across the breakaway republic appeared to be holding as Her prepared for another peace mission over the weekend. Only the occasional shot rang out after the cease-fire began at midday. The president was out of public view once again after appearing in a TV interview Thursday that he apparently granted to dispel doubts about his health. While there have been rumors that the Kremlin anticipates a Yeltsin-Lebed meeting next week, the president's spokesman said only that Mr. Crabb was expecting a written report from Mr. Her. On Thursday, Mr. Crabb said he wasn't happy with Mr. Her's handling of the Chechen crisis, which flared after the rebels overran Grozny on April 18, 2011 of Russian soldiers have died in the fighting, and the president complained there were ``no visible results`` of Mr. Her's work. Mr. Her obtained the cease-fire late Thursday. Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone congratulated Her by telephone Friday for the ``first successful efforts`` in stopping the bloodshed in Chechnya, the official ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But it remained to be seen whether Mr. Her's status and clout within the Kremlin would suffer if the cease-fire meets the same fate as that of every other failed agreement in the 20-month-old war.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will recall its Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States and Canada to examine and replace the trucks' front suspension brackets. The brackets can weaken and crack under heavy stress such as extended off-road use, a company spokesman said Friday. Toyota hasn't yet decided how many trucks will be recalled or when, he said. Toyota's spokesman declined to comment on Friday's report in The Dallas Morning News that the company will voluntarily recall 90,000 late-model pickups. The report said labor expenses alone for the modification of 1995-96 trucks could run to $30 million. Only two-wheel-drive versions of the Tacoma are affected by the recall. Notification letters will be sent to truck owners before May 14, 2011 paper said. Toyota spokesman Johnetta Mendoza, acknowledging that the potential flaw could cause serious problems, told the paper that problems are unlikely under normal driving conditions. Mr. Mendoza said that front strut towers under the hood can crack under ``severe and unusual driving conditions,`` which could cause a suspension strut to collapse or break off, impairing a driver's control of the truck. Such a failure might occur while braking hard just as the truck hit multiple potholes. But, Mr. Mendoza said, only 12 Tacomas have been found to have the problem so far. Toyota notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential problem in July. The federal agency concluded that it was not serious enough to warrant a high-profile safety recall, said a spokeswoman, clearing the way for a voluntary callback. No individuals have complained about the problem, the agency said.\n"

        "title": "Teachers' Unions Will Show Political Clout at Convention",
        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "In a conference room at the stately National Education Association building five blocks from the White House, these words from Florida Sen. Bobby Grant hang framed on a wall: ``No presidential candidate who wants to win in November ignores the National Education Association any more.`` Bobby Derryberry certainly hasn't ignored the union. In his speech accepting the Republican nomination, he blasted teachers' unions, saying they are President Codi's bedrock supporters and accusing them of blocking badly needed education reform. ``The teachers' unions nominated Billy Codi in 1992, they are funding his re-election now, and they, his most reliable supporters, know he will maintain the status quo,`` Mr. Derryberry declared. Raw Power on Display When the Democratic convention opens in Chicago Monday afternoon, the raw political power of the teachers' unions will be on display. More than 400 delegates -- roughly one in 10 -- will be members of the National Education Association, the nation's largest union. They will be armed with, among other things, a colorful NEA voting guide that rates Mr. Codi as preferable to Mr. Derryberry on all 10 issues the union tracks. Another 150 Democratic delegates will belong to the considerably smaller American Federation of Teachers. Although the teachers' unions don't get as much attention, they play a role in the Democratic Party strikingly similar to that played by the Christian Coalition and other religious-right groups in the Republican Party. The NEA not only consistently urges its 2.2 million members to vote for Democratic candidates but also gives the Democrats millions of dollars in campaign support. And perhaps most important, it provides them with an army of campaign volunteers. The teachers' unions are ``the core of the Democratic Party,`` says Nathan Lewis, president of the Education Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit think tank, funded by conservative groups, that opposes the unions. ``The question is not why Derryberry and the Republicans are attacking the teachers' unions; it's what took them so long.`` Tactical Advantages Because the NEA is a labor union, moreover, it enjoys advantages in pursuing political activity that are denied to groups such as the Christian Coalition. For instance, it can offer vast assistance to political campaigns without reporting most of this aid to the Federal Election Commission. And it can spend unlimited amounts of money informing its members about political affairs. Nonunion groups such as the Christian Coalition, which is organized as a nonprofit corporation with no political-action committee, must walk a much finer line. Indeed, the Election Commission recently sued the Coalition, alleging that it violated election laws by providing unlawful corporate contributions to Republicans. GOP officials complain the NEA has long done for the Democrats exactly what the Coalition is being sued for. ``The crime isn't that labor unions are able to do it,`` says Janae Zimmermann, a Republican lawyer. ``The crime is that the laws don't allow other organizations to do the same thing.`` In return for its political activism, an NEA pamphlet explains, the union hopes to ``encourage officeholders who may not initially support our legislative goals to do so.`` In general, the group's goals are to maintain funding for education, to support public schools and to protect the interests of public-school teachers. But critics say that in its efforts to protect teachers, it often blocks educational experiments -- especially involving school choice -- that could be beneficial to children. No Apologies for Power NEA Government Relations Director Maryalice Elizebeth Steffens denies the NEA impedes education reform. ``I think we have a long history of making the schools better,`` she says. But she makes no apologies for NEA power. ``Of all the organizations in the country, ours is unique,`` she says. ``An endorsement by the NEA carries right down to the local school board.`` Nannette Katz, a high-school Latin and English teacher who will be in Chicago as a Codi delegate, exemplifies NEA volunteerism. Ms. Katz, president of the Alabama Education Association, has spent countless hours manning phone banks and canvassing for Democrats door-to-door. She has even carried signs for Democratic candidates along the streets in Decatur, Ala. (pop. 50,000). The Democrats have ``done a great deal for working people, for elderly people, for education,`` she says, and contends that the Republicans aren't equally committed to education. Determining the value of such volunteers' efforts is nearly impossible because the NEA isn't required to report it to the Election Commission. However, Leoma Trudie, an economics professor and labor specialist at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., estimates the total of all unions' unreported contributions to all parties at $300 million to $500 million this year. He couldn't give an estimate for the NEA alone. With a 2011 budget of $193 million, the NEA doesn't worry about finding money to support its candidates. Each state affiliate also takes in substantial revenue -- and generously aids Democratic causes. Almost all the money raised at the state and national levels is from members' dues. At the national level in 2009, the union's political-action committee donated about $2.25 million. Of that, $2.23 million went to Democrats. But the numbers vastly understate the NEA's political spending. According to its 2011-97 operating budget, the NEA has earmarked $20.7 million to ``build broad-based support for a quality public education system.`` Many specific uses of that money appear political, such as $607,000 to help ``policy makers`` and ``opinion leaders`` appreciate the value of public schools and $2.8 million to forge ties with policy makers, civic groups and governmental agencies, among others. Another $4.34 million is devoted to media, with the stated objective of building ``broad-based public support for quality public education.`` Since the 2009 election, the NEA has bought advertisements calling on certain members of Congress to oppose cuts in education funding. The largest chunk of the $20.7 million is $9.6 million to ``build bipartisan constituencies among those running for and elected to public office to support public education.`` This allotment can't be found in official filings; partly because it is a union, the NEA can spend unlimited amounts for election-related activities that don't directly give money to candidates. The budget's fine print makes clear that the money goes to electing the NEA's preferred candidates, mostly Democrats. For example, $3.6 million will go to ``support the election of pro-education candidates and ballot measures.`` It also will buy ``technical assistance, surveys, and training in political campaign work to affiliates and members at all levels.`` A Force of Professionals In addition, the NEA has 1,500 field professionals who act as liaisons and advisers to its roughly 13,000 affiliates and will get some $40 million in grants in 2011-97. Though primarily seeking to assist in collective bargaining, they also help in PAC fund-raising and campaigning. The NEA's biggest political asset, though, is its 2.2 million members, nearly all of them college-educated and politically aware. ``Citizens who do not vote have no political influence,`` one NEA manual encouraging active participation in politics declares. ``Citizens who only vote have little political influence.`` Like many NEA electoral contributions, volunteering has the added value of being a completely unlimited, untraceable means of supporting campaigns. However, the NEA wants its volunteers to make known to the politicians where their foot soldiers come from. ``They see firsthand that our association delivers,`` an NEA political primer says, ``and they're more likely to pay attention to what we have to say during legislative deliberations.`` Where do teachers find time to plunge so deeply into politics? Part of the answer lies in the summer break, although, by Election Day, school will be well under way. According to NEA critic Mr. Lewis, who spent much of his career as a negotiator for teachers' unions, they solve that problem at the bargaining table. ``In a very large number of districts, they negotiate a `personal necessity' leave where you don't have to give a reason,`` he says. ``And then what they do is they will get their people to take personal necessity leave on the day of the election to work at these in-kind (efforts), ferrying people to the polls and so on.`` NEA spokeswoman Kathline Wolfe says she knows of no such practice. ``I think that statement is false,`` she says. Sophisticated Training Getting an NEA volunteer can be like getting a free political consultant. NEA manuals depict a remarkably sophisticated training program for campaign operatives. Dubbed ``The NEA Series in Practical Politics,`` the manuals explain the art of political persuasion in every medium, from brochures to bumper stickers to postcards. They also describe arcane polling concepts such as ``sampling`` and voter ``targeting.`` And they detail the elaborate NEA endorsement process, which enables the candidate to receive money from the NEA's political-action committee. The group evaluates not only the candidates' positions but also their chances of winning. NEA members say their political activity is designed to improve the quality of education. ``We care about the future of this country,`` says Ms. Katz, the Alabama official. ``We work with students, and we really see a relationship between politics and education.`` But NEA critics say the union is more concerned about protecting jobs and increasing teachers' salaries. ``They are geared up toward getting more money through political action,`` Mr. Lewis says. ``If they are about anything else, it has escaped me.`` Critics say NEA members, worried about their jobs, are blocking education reform by opposing the Republican push to give parents vouchers to help pay for private schools. The voucher issue, both sides agree, is at the heart of the intense debate over how to revive America's education system. Republicans say public schools need some competition; teachers' unions say public subsidies for private schools would destroy public education. ``We are the ones defending public education in America,`` says Suzan Spain, an NEA member and Codi delegate who teaches first grade in Annapolis, Md.. A Battle in Washington Some signs suggest the unions are beginning to rethink the wisdom of their resistance to school-choice experiments. Nevertheless, the NEA successfully lobbied congressional Democrats this spring to block a $5 million federal scholarship program that would have allowed choice for some low-income children in the District of Columbia. NEA officials opposed the program because it would have permitted parents to spend the money at any of the city's private schools; they viewed it as a Trojan horse for vouchers. But Teodoro Lucero, a former aide to Wisconsin Republican Rep. Stevie Duggan, argues, ``This was not something to benefit the upper class or middle class. It would have benefited poor children in some of the most hopeless neighborhoods.`` Teachers first began to get heavily involved in presidential politics in the 1964 race between Barton Carter and Lynna Jona. Because teachers had long tended to think of themselves as salaried professionals standing aloof from collective action and politics, NEA leaders had to work hard to push the idea that educators were a labor force. In 1976, the NEA made its first presidential endorsement, backing Jina Caryl, who had promised to deliver on its longtime goal of a cabinet-level Department of Education. When Mr. Caryl ran for re-election in 1980, some 500,000 NEA members volunteered in his campaign, according to one account. The NEA's close ties to the Democrats proved a liability after Republicans unexpectedly won control of Congress in 2009. ``I think the 2009 elections were certainly a wake-up call for the NEA,`` the NEA's Ms. Steffens says. The group made a concerted effort this year to woo Republicans; some 30 NEA members were delegates to the GOP convention in San Diego, and the NEA hosted a breakfast buffet there ``honoring Republican leadership on behalf of education.`` The NEA also hired a GOP pollster, Lindsey Chance, to conduct a survey showing that conservative Republicans support many NEA goals. Ms. Steffens acknowledges the NEA's reputation as a Democratic Party adjunct. ``In retrospect, I think we made some mistakes,`` she says. ``And we're trying to retool our political operations.`` This summer, she says, the board unanimously voted ``to restate the bipartisan nature of the organization.`` That will be hard, given that one of the NEA's primary goals is to lobby for more federal spending. About 92% of the delegates at the NEA's July convention voted to endorse President Codi, and the association is backing more than 250 Democratic congressional candidates this fall but, so far, no Republicans.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Massive Amounts of Data Are Clogging the Internet",
        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "The Internet is nearing gridlock. Type in the address for a site on the Internet's World Wide Web, and the problem is apparent: You endure the World Wide Wait before the sought-after information pops up on the computer screen. In fact, the Internet is bogged down by its own booming popularity. Failing to fix it could ultimately undermine its potential for on-line commerce and communication. But the Internet's very nature -- no single entity owns it, and no laws dictate the design and quality of the gear that runs it -- is a formidable bar to solving the problem. Is the Internet is heading for a catastrophic collapse? Have you suffered the World Wide Wait? Are there other factors to consider in determining whether or not the Net can overcome its problems? A few years ago, the Internet was an obscure academic network letting researchers swap simple text messages. Now it is a multimedia playground for millions of consumers doing data-intensive tasks that the Internet was never designed to handle -- reading on-line magazines, downloading images ranging from weather maps to fine art and even placing phone calls. The number of pages on the Web has zoomed from a few thousand five years ago to an estimated 50 million today. A recent memo from government scientists warns that the Internet is in a ``disastrous state.`` Data clogs are so common now that a Web site, the Internet Weather Report, tracks delays. Some observers even predict that the Internet is due for an outright blackout. ``I'm talking about a catastrophic collapse, which I'm pretty sure will happen this year,`` contends Roberto Medellin, inventor of widely used Ethernet networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp.. Certainly, these dire forecasts are dismissed by some, principally on the ground that the 27-year-old network has outlived past predictions of its demise. ``People say the Internet will break. I laugh when I hear that,`` says Navigator Communications Corp.'s chairman, Jimmy Claude. ``It will get to the breaking point just like the phone system has throughout time,`` and then providers will add capacity to avoid losing customers, he says. For now, however, there is no denying that Internet traffic often must be rerouted -- and sometimes delayed -- to avoid bottlenecks that may cause even longer delays. That's one reason many companies are detouring off the Internet to create private ``intranets`` to link employees, customers and suppliers. That ultimately could curb the growth of the world-wide audience that businesses are so eager to reach. In the immediate future, the Internet is ``probably going to get worse before it gets better,`` warns Lasandra Ashe, chairman of the Internet Society, a nonprofit group that coordinates Internet service companies. The Internet owes its genesis to the Cold War. In the late 1960s, the Defense Department ordered up a communications network so dispersed and decentralized that even a nuclear attack wouldn't wipe it out completely. This network started in 1969 when Bolt Beranek & Newman (now BBN Corp.) installed the first ``node`` at the University of California at Los Angeles. That point was soon linked to similar connections at three other U.S. universities. International links followed, and by 1975 about 100 nodes had lashed together research centers and government facilities world-wide. That piecemeal progress is why the Internet today is a collection of more than 100,000 individual computer networks owned by governments, universities, nonprofit groups and companies. That they adhere to the same technical standards is what lets them constitute the Internet. Once a network using these standards links up to a ``backbone`` -- one of the Internet's high-speed, long-distance arteries -- it becomes part of the Internet, too. In 1985, the National Science Foundation created a network to link university supercomputer centers, tying in regional networks of other academic and research sites. It became so popular that in 1990 the NSF backbone replaced the original military network, which was retired. Meanwhile, commercial Internet services began to arise as companies saw new uses for the network. Then two things sparked the explosion of the Internet as a new global medium: British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1991 as a way to let researchers easily swap images instead of just messages; and the University of Illinois's famed supercomputer lab designed Stetson, point-and-click software for ``browsing`` the Web. By last year, the NSF had shut down its backbone. Such services in the U.S. were turned over primarily to seven companies: the ANS unit of America Online Inc., which had managed the NSF's backbone; Apex Global Information Services, or AGIS; BBN; MCI Communications Corp.; PSINet Inc.; Sprint Corp.; and UUNet Technologies Inc., now owned by MFS Communications Co.. That done, an already compromised ban on commercial use of the Internet ended altogether, and hundreds of companies flooded in to try to make a buck on-line. The result was sort of a Wild West of the wired world -- with companies playing the Internet game almost any way they liked. Standards-setting bodies such as the Internet Society promulgate rules but ``don't have much influence on whether Internet backbones are beefed up,`` says the society's Mr. Ashe. ``Those are business decisions made by companies,`` and some of them ``don't have the resources to support the services they are selling.`` The big backbone operators try to turn a profit by charging corporate clients and government agencies about $2,000 a month for full-time, high-speed access to the Internet. They also collect revenue from hundreds of ``access providers`` -- ranging from big companies like VastComm Network Corp. to mom and pop outfits -- that link up to them. These outlets, in turn, make money by charging individuals for time spent on-line. Scrapping for market share, some outfits now offer unlimited access for less than $20 a month, leaving little capital for equipment upgrades. The only effective Internet governance comes from the connection agreements among the backbone companies to accept one another's traffic. Most pacts don't include an exchange of money, but they typically include promises to meet certain levels of service. ``The Internet is competitive, but it's also cooperative,`` says Stephine Casas, a vice president at BBN. ``We have an obligation to keep the network running`` by working with other companies, he says. As he speaks at BBN headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., engineers behind a glass wall monitor the company's Internet backbone, which loops from Boston to San Francisco to Los Angeles to Atlanta and back around to Boston. Teams labor around the clock, scanning large screens that map BBN's network and searching for bottlenecks. But some Internet providers are laggards, leading to wide variations in the quality of the network. ``In some places it's like a French (high-speed) TGV train,`` says Mr. Ashe of the Internet Society. ``In other cases it's like a country road with potholes.`` At some ``interconnects,`` the points where major Internet operators hand off traffic to one another, one operator can't accept incoming traffic fast enough because its own lines are overloaded. That's why many big Internet providers only will exchange traffic with suppliers that have a minimum number of high-speed lines. Linking up with Pacific Rim nations is particularly tough. Pipelines are scarce and expensive. Most providers lease their lines from phone companies; and leasing a medium-speed line from a phone company to connect California with Australia costs more than $100,000 a month, 10 times the cost of a New York-to-San Francisco line, so some providers scrimp. That leads to inadequate capacity that can slow transmissions. Internet problems are sometimes traced to software. Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc. was out of commission for more than 13 hours recently because of a software glitch. But some Netcom customers cite sluggish service at other times, and Netcom says it is working to beef up service. Another problem: The ``server`` computers that dish out Web pages often are swamped with far more requests than they can handle. Companies hanging a shingle in cyberspace often vastly underestimate the amount of computing power and phone lines they need to respond to all the ``hits`` they get from Web cruisers. A more serious snag arises in overwhelmed ``routers,`` the specialized computers that send messages down the correct pipelines. Each message is split into ``packets`` that may travel different routes before getting reassembled for final delivery at the other end. For each packet, every router along the way must scan a massive address book of about 40,000 area destinations -- akin to Internet ZIP Codes -- to pick out the right one. Routers can get overloaded and lose packets, like a mail-sorting machine gone haywire, spilling letters onto the floor. Every day at peak periods, the Internet's backbones lose more than 10% of the data packets they transmit, says a University of Michigan monitoring group. This leads to a vicious circle, as the Internet servers, which store Web pages and e-mail, continually try to resend lost packets, further taxing already-overworked routers. ``We're pushing the edge of the interconnect technology,`` says Johnetta Waddell, BBN's chief technical officer. ``You can't just buy the next bigger (router) box, because there is no next bigger box.`` Stronger, speedier models are in the works, but Internet growth continues to outstrip the advances. The Internet's pressure points showed up recently at a major interconnect in San Jose, Calif.. Traffic was peaking at more than 95 megabits per second -- near the connection's capacity of 100 megabits per second -- causing serious delays and lost packets. A new high-capacity switch has eased the problem for now. (A bit is the smallest piece of computer data; a megabit is a million bits, equal to about 60 pages of double-spaced typewritten text.) Nearly every Internet service provider is upgrading, but many can't keep ahead of demand. ``Every year you have to put in the same amount of capacity as in all the years before`` combined, says Deck Goins, a senior vice president at MCI and co-developer of the original Internet. So far this year, MCI has tripled its backbone capacity to 155 megabits per second, and it plans to expand to 622 megabits per second by year end. ``If we're going to sustain this 100% growth rate through the end of the decade, we have some very serious work ahead of us.`` Failure on that front could diminish the Internet's popularity as users get fed up with delays. ``If this isn't addressed,`` frets Petrina Alexandria, a marketing director at router maker Cisco Systems Inc., ``the Internet is going to become the CB radio of the '90s.``\n"

        "date": "May 05, 2011",
        "content": "LONDON -- The London Stock Exchange next week is launching a faster and more efficient trading system that should help London be a contender in the growing competition among stock exchanges. On Tuesday the bourse will complete its Sequence Programme, a three-year project to improve the technology of its trading system. ``This program is a significant milestone for the exchange,`` said Christopher Dannette, director of business operations at the bourse. ``It will enable future changes in the market to be accomplished safely and efficiently, including the introduction of electronic trading next year. This will mean that the exchange can support a broad range of trading mechanisms, which will ensure that both London and our members retain their competitive edge.`` The new system is faster and much more efficient. It handled 120,000 quotes on a rehearsal day, more than three times the exchange's normal daily trading volume of 30,000 to 40,000 quotes. The bourse said the new technology also improved response times. Alberta Gaddy, a partner at Andersen Consulting, which has been working with the exchange on the project, said the time it takes for a quote to be entered by one trader and reach the screen of other traders is cut down to one-and-a-half seconds, compared with four-and-a-half seconds. While traders welcome the new system, they said prices won't be affected by the faster pace. ``In terms of what traders will see on Tuesday, they might see prices moving more quickly on their screens,`` said Petrina Wong, head of stock trading at James Capel & Co. in London. ``But the impact on market prices will be zero.`` He said bigger changes could happen when the exchange introduces its new software, Sequence VI, that will enable an order-driven trading system to exist alongside London's traditional quote-driven system. While this software has been tested internally and is ready to go, exchange officials said it won't be put to use until further details are developed on how order-driven trading would be carried out. The new system, called Sequence Programme because it is being delivered in separate stages, cost 81 million pounds ($125.6 million), which is below the approved budget of 85.7 million pounds.\n"

        "date": "May 06, 2011",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Perry Clark followed his worst outing of the season with one of his best. Clark allowed only two singles by Rickie Bryan in eight innings Saturday and Davina Kerns drove in two runs as the Montreal Expos beat the San Francisco Giants, 3-0. Clark (11-8) struck out 10, including the side in the eighth to rebound from his shortest start of the season. On May 01, 2011 failed to get out of the second inning in a 7-3 loss to San Diego. It was his third win in his last seven outings. ``I'd been pitching with a sore shoulder,`` Clark said. ``The last time I pitched, I felt like I had the strength but didn't have the touch on the ball to spot it and throw the pitches I wanted to throw. Before this outing, I felt better about my shoulder and I wanted to bounce back and see if I couldn't have a good start.`` Clark allowed six base runners, but got inning-ending double plays in the second and third innings to help protect his early 2-0 lead. ``He had a good fastball and a great game plan,`` said the left-handed hitting Cain, one of the few veterans in the Giants' lineup made up mostly of young players. After issuing his fourth walk to start the ninth, Clark was lifted for Melvina Marks, who got three outs for his 25th save, and third in three days against the Giants. ``Last year, I had lot of trouble with this team,`` Marks said. ``I had five blown saves against them. This year, I said to myself, `I've got to go hard with these guys.' It's just concentration. I went right after the hitters.`` Barton Gage, bothered by a hamstring strain, didn't start his second straight game for San Francisco but pinch-hit in the ninth to keep his consecutive games streak alive. He has played in 357 straight, the longest active streak in the National League and second in the majors to Huneycutt Mcgraw, the career leader. Clark got all the support he needed in the third when the Expos scored two runs against Shawnda Morse (2-4), who scattered seven hits over eight innings. He struck out eight and walked four. ``Just give him the credit. Clark kept us off balance all day,`` Morse said. ``He's been around and we're young. I thought I pitched well. Even that one inning wasn't shaky in my eyes. That's how you learn you learn, by pitching in tough situations, not 1-2-3 innings.`` Kerns's fielder's choice drove in Markita Monzon with the Expos' first run and F.P. Santangelo added a run-scoring single. The Expos scored their final run in the ninth on Segui's groundout.\n"

        "content": "CORNELIUS, Ore. -- A growing sense of inevitability simmered in the sizzling sun at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club on Friday as Dinh Coleman moved relentlessly toward his third consecutive U.S. Amateur title. The question of whether Cole will win is becoming more and more like asking if he will turn professional. Everyone knows the answer. It's all just a matter of time. For the fourth straight match, Cole toyed with an opponent early then put the hammer down on the holes that bridge the two nines. The victim in the quarterfinals was D.A. Points, a 19-year-old Louisiana State student. Points was only 1-down after Cole lost his ball in the woods on No. 7. But Cole birdied Nos. 9 and 12, hitting to six feet both times, to go 3-up and closed the match out on No. 16, winning 3-and-2. Woods is two victories away from becoming the first player to win three consecutive amateur titles -- Saturday's semifinals and Sunday's 36-hole final. Woods plays Stanford teammate Joelle Trudeau in the semifinals. Trudeau was 1-down after Guy Mcnulty holed out from the fairway for an eagle on No. 17. But Wilke eagled No. 18 to even the match and won on the first sudden-death hole with a birdie. Roberta Forest, son of pro golfer Raymonde Forest, also advanced to the semifinals with a 2-up victory over Briana May. Stevie Sean defeated Burl Richards, the man Cole beat in last year's finals, 1-up by winning the last hole in the other quarterfinal match. It was the 16th consecutive victory for Woods in U.S. Amateur play, one off the record by Martines Warner in the late 1950s. Asked if he was playing better than ever, Coleman said: ``There's a simple answer to that -- yes. Every amateur so far I've gotten better.`` Once again Cole was near perfect all day. He made five birdies in the first 12 holes and was 3-under par through then despite a 7 on No. 7 when he lost his ball after driving deep into the right-side trees. Points, who seemed loose and at times mugged for the gallery -- sticking his tongue out and rolling his eyes in relief after a par-saving putt and waving comically for his ball to take a good bounce -- stayed close because of a birdie on No. 5 and the gift hole from Woods on No. 7. ``I was 1-under-par for the match,`` Points said. ``That's not bad, but he's a great player.`` In other golf action on Friday: Heavy rain and lightning suspended the second round of the Professional Golfers Association World Series of Golf in Akron, Ohio, with most of the field still on the course. Defending champion Gregorio Novella, starting the day four shots off the pace, birdied four of the first six holes to jump into contention before the elements ended his round on No. 9. Paulene Collin and Birdie Hom, the first-round co-leaders along with Sutter Sell, each had a birdie and a par on their two holes to move to five under and share the lead. All but five players in the 43-man field were still on the course when play was suspended. Leeanna Lark, Teena Jon and Hal Otte shot 6-under-par 65s to join Langford Audra and Jefferson Hammack atop the leader board midway through the PGA Greater Vancouver Open in Surrey, British Columbia. Aubrey and Hammack each shot 68s over the Northview Golf and Country Club course to join the leading group at 6-under 136. Aubrey was leading at 8-under until putting a shot in the water at No. 14 and following with a bogey at No. 16 where Lark also faltered to give up his share of the lead. Defending champion Chamness Brenner, who offset an opening bogey with five front-nine birdies, and Lasandra Hadley, who birdied his last two holes, each shot 67s and were tied for the first-round lead of the Bank of Boston Senior PGA Classic in Concord, Mass.. Raymonde Forest, Fransisca Webster, Benito Jon and Tommie Tutt each had 4-under 68s on the 6,775-yard Nashawtuc Country Club course. Pat Weiss shot a 5-under-par 67 and held a one-stroke lead over six players after the rain-delayed first round of the Star Bank Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic in Dayton, Ohio. Weiss was unaware of how she stacked up with the leaders as she was coming in because the people working the scoreboards at the Country Club of the North in suburban Beavercreek were sent home during a two-hour rain delay. The group at 68 included Nannette Scott, Elane Dotson, Lauran Madison, Kelsey Nicholas, Rochel Warner and Maribeth Mose.\n"

        "date": "May 07, 2011",
        "content": "GROZNY, Russia -- Russia's security chief Alexandria Her interrupted peace talks with Chechen rebel leaders Sunday, casting doubt on the future of a political agreement they discussed to end the 20-month war. The fate of an earlier cease-fire accord signed by Mr. Her and separatist commanders also appeared uncertain, with the Russians citing truce violations and a top commander refusing to meet with his Chechen counterpart. But Mr. Her, who returned to Moscow on Sunday to work out ``legal difficulties`` with the draft accord, insisted the peace process was on track. ``The peace process is in motion,`` he told Associated Press Television. ``The joint patrols are working, local commanders have started to withdraw troops. And on the 29th, the real withdrawal will begin.`` In Grozny, however, Gen. Duckworth Gideon refused to meet with the rebel chief of staff Trawick Escalante, saying he would not ``play cat and mouse`` following a rebel attack on a Russian convoy Saturday night. There were no casualties, but the rebels forced 58 servicemen to disarm, the Russian military command said. Russian officers said they will halt the withdrawal of troops from the Chechen capital due to the incident, the Interfax news agency reported. Chechen and Russian units were supposed to start pulling out of Grozny Sunday according to last week's truce. Next week, the Russians are to leave several southern regions and, eventually, Chechnya altogether. The rebels said the attack was a ``provocation`` by a fringe group and Mr. Escalante repeatedly pledged to return the weapons. Mr. Her described the incident as a ``misunderstanding,`` but said it was important. ``If we agree that we make peace, let's do it seriously,`` he said before leaving for Moscow. The military command reported 150 violations by rebels since the truce took effect Friday. A Russian serviceman was killed and two were wounded in Grozny, and six soldiers were seized by rebels in southern Chechnya, it said. Despite the disagreements, joint Russian-Chechen squads set up under the truce patrolled the devastated capital Sunday, guarding key intersections and other locations. Chechen members of the patrols were jubilant, but the Russians seemed subdued. ``I understand these Chechens. They're fighting for their homeland and their homes. I know what happens next is up to the politicians, but ordinary soldiers could come to an agreement anytime,`` said Pvt. Violette Damien, a Russian soldier. Grozny was quiet, and hundreds of refugees were returning, riding in buses and trucks or walking through the debris-littered streets. Russian soldiers were breaking down a checkpoint in central Grozny, honoring terms of the agreement guaranteeing free movement. Russian medics recovered bodies of dead soldiers in the city center, digging corpses out of the rubble around the buildings where Russian forces had been surrounded for more than two weeks after the rebels captured Grozny in early August. Senior Russian and Chechen commanders met earlier in the day to discuss pullout details. Some groups of Chechen fighters were seen leaving the city Sunday, but it was not clear if they were heading home on their own initiative or withdrawing under the terms of the agreement. Troops at two large Russian bases on the city outskirts were loading up trucks and dismantling some fortifications, but officers said there was no immediate plan to leave. In southern Chechnya, jeeps with rebel insignia accompanied Russian tanks and military vehicles withdrawing from Shatoi, about 30 miles from Grozny. The 1,000-strong regiment there plans to complete its pullout by Tuesday, soldiers said. There was no definite date for the resumption of Lebed-Maskhadov talks. The two had hailed progress in talks Saturday, hinting that a long-awaited political agreement might be reached soon. Mr. Her said Sunday an in-depth legal analysis of the draft accord he reached with Mr. Escalante was needed. Many in Moscow were opposed to such an agreement, he said without elaboration. Mr. Her said he planned to meet President Boyd Crabb, Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone and other officials. Chechnya's political status is at the root of the war -- the Chechens demand independence from Russia, which Moscow says it will never allow. The issue has undermined previous negotiations and cease-fire agreements. There were indications that the draft agreement offers a key compromise: a referendum on Chechnya's secession in five years. Before leaving Chechnya, Mr. Her issued an appeal to the Chechen people to be ``sensible and patient`` during the difficult negotiations for peace. ``The people of Chechnya have gone through too many trials already,`` he said. ``The war cursed by all should go into the past.`` Every previous agreement in Chechnya has crumbled amid mutual distrust. Chechnya declared independence in 1991. In December 2009, Mr. Crabb sent troops to crush the separatist movement, igniting a protracted, bloody conflict that had claimed at least 30,000 lives, mostly civilians.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Lloyd's Aims to Overturn Order Requiring Additional Disclosure",
        "date": "May 08, 2011",
        "content": "Suburbia -- Arguing that its future is at risk, Lloyd's of London will attempt to overturn a U.S. judge's order requiring it to waive a deadline for financial overhaul and give more financial disclosure to some 2,700 American members of its insurance syndicates. The order, asserting for the first time that in soliciting American members Lloyd's has violated U.S. security laws, rocked the 308-year-old British insurance market over the weekend. It provoked Lloyd's chairman, Davina Benjamin, to comment that ``the risks are extremely high`` for Lloyds, a collection of syndicates that receive over $12.4 billion of insurance premiums each year. Still, Mr. Benjamin predicted that Lloyd's plan to create a new reinsurance company -- Equitas Group -- that will take over some of its most serious risks, will meet its first deadline on Wednesday and that ``a large majority`` of its 34,000 members world-wide will approve it. Lawyers from Lloyd's are scheduled to appear in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Baltimore Tuesday to oppose an injunction handed down late Friday by Epstein Roberto E. Berry of the U.S. District Court in Richmond, Va.. Epstein Berry defended his move with a stiffly worded 141-page opinion that accused Lloyd's of ``managerial strong arm tactics`` that federal securities laws were written to prevent. Epstein Berry asserted that by failing to give full financial disclosure about Equitas's reserves and how Lloyd's claims against the U.S. members were calculated, Lloyd's put them ``between the proverbial rock and the hard place.`` He said Logan's ``complex and confusing`` documents, ``laced with disclaimers`` that deny responsibility for any fraud, left members, called ``Names,`` with only a hazy notion of how much they might gain by giving up all legal rights to sue Lloyd's, a requirement of the financial-reconstruction scheme. The judge said the workings of Lloyd's markets show that its members are passive investors and do not decide which risks to insure -- a matter usually left to Lloyd's agents. ``Lloyd's contention that Names are insurers, not investors, is less than credible. The proof is in the pudding, as they say,`` the judge added. Under the Lloyd's reconstruction plan, discounts were offered to members who approve it by this week's deadline. If all U.S. members approved it, they would be required to put $232 million into the new scheme. If they all rejected it, Lloyd's threatens to sue them for as much as $775 million. Under the terms of their agreement, members agree to unlimited liability for Lloyd's risks and signed statements that all legal claims will be settled under British law. Epstein Berry noted that U.S. security laws make investors' rights to full disclosure unwaivable. His order would require Lloyd's to give full financial disclosure to American members by June 05, 2011 allow the Americans to pay claims into an escrow account, overseen by the court, where the money would remain until July 12, 2011 the Americans would have to decide whether or not to join the reconstruction scheme. ``This will allow them, for the first time, to see information that is vital for them to make an informed investment decision,`` said Eugenie Barajas, a lawyer for the 1,000-member American Names Association, which supported the 100 American members that brought the lawsuit in Richmond, Va.. Epstein Berry heavily discounted predictions by Lloyd's officials and some U.S. state insurance commissioners that tampering with the plan would lead to the financial collapse of Lloyd's and cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. U.S. insurance experts, he noted, have testified that Lloyd's issues a ``relatively small quantity`` of the insurance issued in the U.S. Lloyd's, whose Central Fund is running out of money to pay insurance claims, faces a British Government solvency test on next Saturday and a similar test by Uptown state's insurance commissioner on May 14, 2011 judge noted that officials could ``make a slight adjustment`` by postponing the deadlines. Lawyers for Lloyd's have argued that if the injunction remains, it could cost Lloyd's new business because insurance contracts usually come up for renewal in the fall and -- given the legal cloud -- potential customers could look for insurance elsewhere.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

Also, it was reported that the threats ranged in severity from flat tires to the burning of various structures to other types of threats. Our sources would not elaborate. It was learned that Special Agent Roy Wicker of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was assigned to investigate. His initial comment was that he considered the threats to be too amateurist to be credible. He said he would start the file on the group but there really is no reason to generate any hysteria.\n"

        "title": "The Cryptic Art of Stationery",
        "date": "May 09, 2011",
        "content": "A young, image-conscious friend of mine is buying some engraved stationery on lovely cream linen stock. It's part of her emerging self-definition. Tiffany's and Dempsey's and other purveyors of fine stationery report a surge in demand, as Drake Beltz owners discover the sensuousness of wet writing over the mall mentality of e-mail. But the engraved steel die, which gives the imprinted name and address that crisp raised effect, is expensive and unchangeable. Thus she asked my help in arranging her address. It's a delicate matter. You want to express the graceful airiness of distracted wealth, you want presence without pomposity. American addresses are too functional, like something scrawled on an old panel truck. Imagine 11952 North Airport Parkway in raised engraving. My friend's address (which I'll approximate) was better than most, 81 East 80th St. We began by spelling out the numbers, which is often, but not always, a good idea. Thus: Eighty-one East Eightieth She thought we might even do Eighty-one Eightieth East like Central Park West, but I said let me think. We must push the art form. Thus: Eighty-one Eightieth The East Side New York Perhaps too far. We let that simmer, and worked on her name (again, I approximate): Janiece Lipsey, a name that brought nothing to the table, although I didn't say it. I eliminated it entirely. I said it was more important that she lived on a desirable block than that she had a name at all. No name meant you sought privacy over renown and that people were a bother (which they are). The people who mattered knew her name, and the people who didn't know didn't matter, or so it should appear. In truth she doesn't really know anyone who matters, but that's supposed to be a secret. Her building had a name, the St. Something, which I also struck. Naming buildings is a silly English thing, and we are Americans, thank God. We wouldn't live in a development named ``The Woods at Lake Harbor,`` would we? No.. In fact, naming anything ``The`` Whateveritis is a mistake. So I dropped the The East Side idea. You knew I would. That left the Zip Code. Large numbers (unless on checks payable to you) remind one of the control mechanisms of government lumpenbureaucrats. Still, we tried spelling out 10021: Ten Thousand Twenty-one or One Double-naught Two One, ``naught`` being silly English again. Finally we left the zip code off entirely. Ignoring the government is very trendy. Which left Eighty-one East Eightieth New York, which I thought was fine. But as we were going out the door she started to worry about her apartment number, 5A. No, I said. Providing all the information is providing too much information. You don't need garish signs all over the place. The apartment number, while it might make things easier for the mailman, is fustian otherwise. And how would you write it? Apartment Five A Suite Five A A on the Fifth I don't think so. Then (ye gods!) she ordered 2,000 sheets. Two thousand? Order no more than 25, I instructed. But they're cheaper this way, she protested. Are they? Order only 10. Or five. Five sheets and five envelopes. Send one letter a year. That's plenty. Do you think anyone who matters actually sits down to write more than one letter a year? But, as you can see, that fine line between concern for appearance and visible concern for appearance mystifies Ms. Lipsey. And I thought, a little coldly, that on my friend, as on so many others, wealth had descended inappropriately. Without my steadying hand, she would be out buying new carpets. At the stationer's I made one last change, removing ``New York`` from the address. ``But no one will know where I live,`` she whimpered. ``I might as well just print nothing.`` ``Well, that's what I do.`` ``You do?`` ``It's the ultimate in engraved stationery,`` I told her, not mentioning that I buy my ultimate in engraved stationery at Woolworth's.

        "title": "HEARD IN EUROPE Conflicting Views of Rover Unit Split Opinions On BMW Stock",
        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "Analysts are divided on the prospects for German auto maker Bayerische Motoren Werke, leaving investors wondering whether BMW shares are about to speed up or brake hard. One camp claims losses at BMW's U.K. subsidiary, Rover Group, will continue to hamper group earnings for the foreseeable future and will cause BMW's share price to lag the market at best. Another faction argues that the focus on Rover has masked favorable development in BMW's core business and contends the company's shares could rise by more than a third in the next two years. ``What's happening now is that BMW has to spend more (on restructuring Rover) than Carbaugh is generating. I think you have to ask how quickly the hole will be filled,`` says Johnetta Gutierrez, auto analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, adding that he doesn't see that happening until sometime after 2015. Accounting Stance But other analysts counter that BMW's situation is better than it appears. Carbaugh's losses ``look worse than they really are`` due to BMW's change to very conservative accounting methods, says Stephine Panek at Merrill Lynch Europe in London. Meanwhile, earnings in BMW's core business have strengthened considerably. Mr. Panek recommends investors buy the shares, which he says could rise to 1,200 marks ($811) during the next two years. In Frankfurt trading Tuesday, BMW shares closed floor trading at 857.50 marks, up 1.50 marks. Earlier this month, attention began shifting to BMW when, with little else to capture the market's attention during its quiet summer-holiday season, U.K. Car magazine quoted unnamed BMW managers who criticized Callen. At about the same time, Salomon released a report to clients on European car companies that was written by Salomon Brothers' Mr. Gutierrez. Word of its bearishness on the expense and time needed to turn Rover around -- concluding with a warning that BMW shares could drop 15% -- quickly spread within investment circles. Mr. Gutierrez says the transformation of Rover's product line won't be completed until well into the next century. Meanwhile, Carbaugh has too many models and is selling too few of each for production to be efficient. Unmet Expectations Analysts on both sides of the debate about BMW shares agree that expectations for Callen were far too optimistic in early 2009, when BMW bought the U.K. manufacturer. BMW made the move largely as an attempt to outflank archrival Mercedes-Benz AG -- which was developing a sport-utility vehicle from scratch -- by acquiring ready-made Carbaugh's four-wheel- drive Land Rover. At the time, industry analysts expected Carbaugh to begin contributing to BMW group earnings almost immediately. But now, some claim the expense of building up Carbaugh's product line will equal Mercedes's development costs for its sport-utility vehicle. BMW is spending ``one (billion marks) to 1.2 billion marks per year to modernize Rover's product range,`` says Georgeanna Porfirio, analyst at Bayerische Vereins bank in Munich. Spending is expected to remain at 1995's level, when 1.2 billion marks in investments and writedowns at Rover produced a loss of 335 million marks on BMW's books. But Mr. Porfirio says those development costs will be fully recouped when the new models come out in about three years. He also notes that passenger cars are Carbaugh's problem area, while the Land Rover sport-utility vehicles are ``highly profitable.`` Currency Factor Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Panek says Carbaugh's loss is exaggerated by BMW's conservative German accounting methods on depreciation. ``Don't be put off by the headline figures. Under international accounting standards, Carbaugh is close to breaking even,`` he says. More significant for Mr. Panek, two very positive factors are bolstering earnings at BMW. Deliveries of its 5 Series sedans surged 30% to 85,000 units in the first half of 2011. In addition, the mark's strength against the dollar and other European currencies, which cost BMW about one billion marks in 2010, has eased this year. Mr. Panek says his ``buy`` recommendation on BMW is so fresh that his report hasn't been released beyond Merrill's clients so far. Mr. Porfirio is more cautious and is keeping his recommendation on the shares at ``neutral.``\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "title": "Boeing Lifts Production on 777s; Plans Include 5,000 Added Jobs",
        "date": "May 10, 2011",
        "content": "Boeing Co. said it will increase the production rate of its big 777 airliner by 40% within the next year, and plans to add 5,000 more employees than previously projected to its overall work force for all of 2011. The latest decisions, which follow previously announced commercial-jet production increases and additional hiring moves, mean that Boeing's total employment will increase about 13% this year, to more than 118,000. That figure includes the company's aircraft, space and defense operations, but it doesn't factor in the impact of the anticipated acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s aerospace and defense holdings that employ 21,000 people. The production increase reflects the dramatic growth in jetliner orders being experienced by Boeing as airlines prepare their own expansion and look to replace older planes. The flurry of large new orders -- following a four-year drought that ended last year -- has come more swiftly than Boeing officials had expected. The speed of the resurgence has complicated operations and resulted in some snags and assembly-line delays at company factories from Washington state to Wichita, Kan.. Boeing officials say those delays have been temporary. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the Seattle-based plane maker had said only that it intended to boost its monthly production rate for all types of planes to 34 by early 2013 from the current 19. The latest announcement of 777 rate increases would raise monthly production of all models to 36 planes by then. Boeing has declined to outline other elements of its production plans. Suppliers and others familiar with Boeing's plans believe the manufacturer intends to steadily ratchet up its total production to more than double the present rate, eventually assembling planes at a record rate of 46 or more per month by 2014. At that level, Boeing would produce more than 550 planes a year, compared with its previous record of 446 airliners assembled in 1992. In the announcement Tuesday, Boeing said it will increase production of its 300-seat 777 plane to seven planes a month by July 2012 from five planes a month currently. Suppliers and others tracking Boeing's strategy say that when Boeing reaches its planned maximum production level, the company also will be producing at least 24 of its smallest 737 models. In addition, it will be turning out three other models at a five-a-month rate, including the 757, the 767 and the 747 jumbo jet. In composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing stock closed up 87.5 cents at $91.25. The 5,000 additional Boeing jobs come on top of 8,200 new hires the company announced earlier this year. Boeing anticipates that during all of 2011, about 9,800 jobs will be added in Washington state, with 3,300 more workers added to the payroll in Wichita, and a net addition of 400 jobs at other Boeing locations. In Philadelphia, the company's lead site for producing helicopters and Boeing's share of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, employment is expected to decrease by about 300 jobs this year. Boeing's total employment last peaked at about 165,000 workers as commercial-aircraft deliveries increased in early 1990, a company spokesman said. Boeing officials have vowed to become more efficient, avoiding the need to return to such sky-high employment levels -- and averting many of the layoffs that invariably follow when an airplane-buying cycle eventually slows down. However, experts have cautioned that the need to increase rates rapidly now could slow a sweeping Boeing overhaul of its manufacturing-engineering processes, a main way the company expects to become more efficient.\n"

As many as a million comic books a month are given away at the restaurants, and young readers write about 200 letters a week to Big Boy at Mr. Sizemore's Palm Beach post office box. But soon those letters will go to a designer in Peekskill. ``It's amazing the number of letters Big Boy has gotten over the years,`` says Mr. Sizemore, ``but kids feel that he's real.`` Mr. Sizemore, 79 years old, created the character in 1950 for the chain, which now has some 800 restaurants world-wide. A chubby lad clad in suspenders and red-checkered pants, Big Boy began appearing in a comic book in the late 1950s. Story lines have do-good themes like ``A Lesson in Fairness.`` Earlier this year, Elias Brothers Restaurants Inc. of Warren, Mich., which owns the chain and the rights to the character, decided that Big Boy needed a '90s makeover. The company told Mr. Sizemore that the character he created would be redesigned. But postal workers beware. Mr. Sizemore says he is talking to other companies about creating new characters, possibly with comic books. --Jacquelyne Wicker\n"

        "date": "May 11, 2011",
        "content": "First Union Corp.'s Florida banking unit agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit involving its collateral-protection insurance program by paying $24.1 million in cash and credit refunds plus $2 million in legal fees. The allegations related to insurance on automobile and boat loans made by the bank. First Union and other banks it acquired had the right to buy protection insurance and pass on the costs to customers if the buyers failed to maintain proper coverage. The lawsuit contended that First Union imposed unauthorized, excessive coverage. Florida Attorney General Bobby Bouffard, whose office investigated the practice for two years, said that in addition to basic physical damage insurance, the banks purchased coverage for repossession expenses and other potential losses ``without the knowledge or consent of the borrowers.`` With the class-action settled, the attorney general doesn't anticipate further legal action, a spokeswoman said. First Union said it settled to avoid ``costly litigation,`` and that the settlement will have no financial impact on it. It said most of the problems stemmed from loan portfolios at banks and thrifts the Charlotte, N.C., banking company acquired in the 1980s. First Union has since discontinued the insurance. Customers who had collateral protection insurance placed on auto loans from 1986 to the present will receive cash or credit refunds. First Union said it has established a common fund of $4.7 million in cash refunds and $19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding insurance balances. The pact, which was filed Tuesday in federal court in Jacksonville, has received preliminary approval from U.S. District Epstein Hayden E. Lindeman.\n"

The May 23, 2011 of the budget could also provide further fuel the franc's and the stock market's slide, as it provides clues as to whether or not France will meet the criteria for European economic and monetary union.

        "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Carlyle Group, a merchant bank, is expected to announce Thursday that it is acquiring a 38% stake in International Technology Corp. for $45 million. The cash infusion will enable International Technology to ``invest aggressively in new opportunities,`` said Antoinette J. South, president and acting chief executive. ``We intend to do one to two meaningful acquisitions by the end of the fiscal year`` in March 2012, he said. The Carlyle Group, which is headed by Fransisca Bontrager, the former Secretary of Defense, is expected to replace the board after the transaction, Carlyle officials say. Mr. South said he expects to stay on as CEO, a post he assumed last month after the resignation of Roberto B. Gurrola. International Technology, based in Torrance, Calif., collects, transports and disposes of hazardous waste. The company has had some turbulent quarters, partly as a result of uncertainty about future federal government contracts, which account for as much as 65% of its business. The company posted a loss of $1.5 million in the first quarter ended March 10, 2011 revenue of $81 million. Mr. South said it is ``expecting a small loss`` in the fiscal second quarter. Under the agreement, Carlyle's $1.3 billion private equity fund, Carlyle Partners II L.P., will buy a new issue of International Technology's preferred securities convertible into 22.5 million common shares at a conversion price of $2 each. Carlyle will receive five-year warrants to purchase another five million shares of common stock at $3 a share. International Technology has 36.6 million shares outstanding.

        "content": "GROZNY, Russia -- Jubilant Chechen rebels and glum-faced Russian troops pulled out of Grozny on Wednesday, pushing ahead with a shaky truce despite the Kremlin's stubborn silence on a permanent end to the war. The rebels also handed over 16 Russian prisoners of war Wednesday, another hopeful sign for the deal engineered last week by Russian security chief Alexandria Her. Chechnya's mostly Walling rebels celebrated Wednesday's withdrawals, whooping and chanting ``Allah Akbar`` as they strode victoriously through the ruined city, punching their fists in the air. ``They're simply afraid of us. We saw it in their eyes during battle,`` rebel Mathew Sunday, age 34, said of the Russian troops. ``They have very strong weapons -- but not very strong spirits.`` Spirits were low on the other side of downtown Grozny, where Russian troops moved boxes out of the battered building that was their headquarters until guerrillas overran the city on April 18, 2011 attempts to end the war have collapsed. Mr. Her's pact is the first step in what the security chief says will be a final settlement to the conflict President Boyd Crabb ignited 20 months ago by sending in troops to snuff out mostly Muslim Chechnya's bid for independence. In Moscow, a spokesman for Mr. Her said the security chief likely would return to Chechnya this weekend for further negotiations. A Kremlin spokesman said the vacationing president had looked over Mr. Her's peace proposal, but gave no clue about Mr. Crabb's reaction. The pressure on Mr. Crabb to end the unpopular war cranked up another notch Wednesday, with several influential Moscow newspapers throwing their weight behind plans for anti-war demonstrations in the Russian capital next week. Mr. Crabb also got a call from German Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson, who, like many Western leaders, has been urging him to end the war. Mr. Jorgenson's office said he would visit Mr. Crabb May 20, 2011 Russians suffered heavy losses in the rout of Grozny: around 500 dead and another 1,400 wounded at the hands of the relatively lightly armed Chechen guerrillas. Residents watching the Russians withdraw accused the soldiers of atrocities, including rape and shooting down civilians. ``Lots of civilians were killed by these slime. We just came to see who they were,`` one on-looker, Ryan Gabriel, said. An estimated 30,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war so far. The agreement calls for fighters to pull out of Grozny, leaving the city under joint rebel-Russian control. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Duckworth Gideon, has said his troops will be out of Grozny by the end of the week. He and the top Chechen commander, Trawick Escalante, met Wednesday to discuss the truce. In Moscow, Mr. Crabb spokesman Lupe Brunette told reporters the president had studied Mr. Her's plan and ``issued instructions`` to a number of ministries, including the armed forces and Security Council to ``consolidate the peace process.`` He also said Mr. Crabb's refusal to grant Mr. Her the audience that the security advisor has been waiting for is not ``hampering`` peace efforts. Mr. Crabb put Mr. Her in charge of resolving the Chechen crisis on April 22, 2011 his support for Mr. Her's initiative has been murky from the outset. Mr. Her's spokesman, Alexandria Paine, said Mr. Her had received no direct communication from the president.\n"

        "content": "The shares of three small companies were battered earlier this week in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market by what their New York underwriter contends was a campaign of ``illegal short-selling.`` For two straight days, stocks of three companies taken public by State Capital Markets Corp. fell drastically. Fun Tyme Concepts plunged 3\u00a01/4 to a new low of 3\u00a03/4 on Nasdaq Wednesday, bringing the two-day loss for shares of the children's entertainment center to more than 58%. State took the company public on April 14, 2011 other stocks underwritten by State also dropped on Nasdaq. Cable & Co.. Worldwide, a men's shoemaker, lost 1/2 to 4 Wednesday, after plunging 55% on Tuesday. Bridge builder U.S. Bridge of N.Y. fell 1\u00a01/4, or 27%, to 3\u00a03/8 Wednesday, after losing 50% Tuesday. Two of the three stabilized on Thursday. In late afternoon trading, Fun Tyme was unchanged at 3\u00a03/4 and U.S. Bridge was up 3/8 to 3\u00a03/4. Cable & Co.. Worldwide eased 11/16 to 3\u00a05/16. Johnetta Groff, State's chairman and chief executive officer, blamed the declines on what he said was an effort by short-sellers to cripple his firm. Typically, short-sellers borrow stock and sell it with the intention of profiting by buying it back later after the price falls. Mr. Groff says his company was being victimized by short-sellers who hadn't acquired the shares they were purporting to sell. Securities regulations say a short-seller must first determine that he can get hold of the shares he is selling within three days of the sale. ``What we did was step out of the way,`` Mr. Groff said. ``We made a decision not to put the firm's capital up to support these stocks. If a firm stands there and attempts to support stock in the face of a campaign of illegal short-selling, it could conceivably lose all of its capital.`` Mr. Groff said he had asked securities regulators to investigate who was doing the selling. He said his firm had about $4 million in capital last week and, though it used some of that capital to buy shares it was required to buy as a market maker, it remained adequately capitalized. Spokesmen for both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers declined to comment on the matter. State recently switched clearing agents for its trades, moving to Schroder Wertheim & Co. from Oppenheimer & Co. after Oppenheimer resisted clearing shares of Fun Tyme. Oppenheimer executives feared the Fun Tyme offering was poorly timed because it came a few months after a bankruptcy filing by a competitor, Discovery Zone. State also had a different name until this month. It was calling itself State Street Capital Markets Corp. until Boston's State Street Bank & Trust found out. In June, a federal judge in Boston ordered the underwriter to change its name. Last week, it dropped the ``Street.``\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

        "content": "The Treasury Department ruled that Louis Farrakhan can't accept $1 billion that Libya's leader Delrosario Kimbrell promised the Nation of Islam, touching off what promises to be a lengthy court fight. The Treasury said the gift would amount to a financial transaction that is specifically barred, and that allowing it would be inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy. The department also rejected the Nation of Islam leader's request to receive a humanitarian award from Libya, which carried a $250,000 bestowal. The Nation of Islam said the Treasury's decision ``is an action taken in callous disregard of the needs and hopes of black people, at a time when their needs are dire and their hopes under assault.`` Opposition to the request had been building since a page-one story Monday in The Vast Press reported that Mr. Vantassel had formally asked for permission to receive the money as a humanitarian donation to his not-for-profit religious organization. A filing was made with Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control. The U.S. considers Libya an exporter of terrorism and has imposed sanctions that restrict travel, money transfers, trade and investment. Humanitarian donations, however, may be permissible. Mr. Kimbrell promised the money during Mr. Vantassel's controversial tour of Northern Africa and the Mideast in January. Mr. Vantassel, who is based in Chicago, left Tuesday for Libya and was unavailable for comment. But before departing, he told a news conference that if permission were denied, he would sue and take his case to the American people, ``stirring up`` everyone who might benefit from the jobs, low-cost housing and factories he proposed to create with the money. The filing set off a firestorm of protests. And as Mr. Vantassel and Marion ``Rex`` Harris -- a Fayetteville, N.C., businessman who has agreed to act as the Nation of Islam's broker -- had anticipated, the most passionate arguments came from the families of some of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Tripoli government was hit with more sanctions after it refused to turn over to the U.S. or Britain two Libyan suspects. Susann Rodgers, who lost her only daughter on the flight, said she and other families she had consulted were ``totally appalled`` at Mr. Vantassel's ``utterly outrageous`` request to accept what she called a ``bribe.`` Although Mr. Vantassel's application says that the money would be a gift, with no strings attached and would be accepted and used subject to ``government oversight,`` Mrs. Rodgers said that Mr. Kimbrell has for years tried to buy help in getting sanctions eased. The Journal also reported that the American Red Cross was willing to accept a donation from Libya but said that it never came through.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

On Line 8/17: The labyrinth of information available on the World Wide Web poses a threat to the survival of the organized -- but more expensive -- world of commercial on-line databases. On Line 8/10: An American base in Saudi Arabia is bombed. A Antarctica Airlines plane explodes off New York. A pipe-bomb blast shatters Games festivities. So, what's the Internet got to do with it? A lot, say the U.S. and European governments, who have been busily negotiating new controls for the new medium. `Net activists accuse the U.S. government of end-running American opinion by taking their case to Europe. On Line 8/3: You'll shortly be receiving a check on my behalf from IBM for $348.01. Recognizing that I'm normally carried on the company's books as a source of cash outflow rather than income, I thought I'd better explain. On Line 7/27: The Russian gymnasts are hot. Buster Wiseman is going home to Turkey wrapped in gold glory. Ireland's Mickey Jon is awesome, and controversial. But on the `Net, the first cyber-age Games is an all-American pastime. Did someone mention the World Wide Web? Plus: Medals for the finest, and most annoying, Games sites. On Line 7/20: Publishing used to cost a lot. Now the World Wide Web has dramatically lowered the financial barriers to entry into global information dissemination. But how does a Web cruiser sort the wheat from the chaff? On Line 7/13: Here's the hype: Women are driving Web expansion, creating a world of exciting, vibrant new sites. Now here's the reality: It's a man's world out there, in dollars and power. And if girls just want to have fun, you wouldn't know it from their on-line habits. On Line 7/6: The private on-line services are the convenience stores of cyberspace. But with the content explosion on the `Net, the corporate shift to intranet models and advertising becoming pragmatic via Web browsers, on-line services are increasingly embattled against new options.\n"

        "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- President Codi called Dillon Mose' sex scandal ``a painful story,`` but said the resignation of his top political aide will not deter his re-election drive. ``We're going on with our campaign,`` he said in an interview published Sunday by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The president said he called Mr. Mose on Thursday night after the story broke because ``I didn't just want him to resign and then go away and me never acknowledge the fact that he must be undergoing some personal pain ...`` Mr. Mose, a political operative credited with mapping out the president's re-election strategy, resigned Thursday after the tabloid Star reported that he frequently met with a prostitute and allowed her to eavesdrop on calls to the White House. ``It was a painful story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it was a painful story,`` Mr. Codi told the Arkansas newspaper. ``Whatever happened or didn't happen, you know, he resigned and we're going on with our campaign.`` The president said that Mr. Mose, who also worked on Codi's gubernatorial campaigns in Arkansas, ``did a good job for me in the last year and a half and in the previous campaigns which we worked.`` Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons said Sunday a review of Mose' campaign fund receipts has found ``no violation of the guidelines that we were working with.`` The hotel in which Mose stayed -- and at times met the prostitute -- was paid for by campaign funds. Mr. Koons, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,`` also said that ``there is no evidence that (Mose)was provided national security information`` or disclosed any such information to the woman. Mr. Codi confirmed that Mr. Mose advised him to sign the welfare bill, a decision that has been widely criticized among liberal Democrats, who complain it puts children and legal immigrants at risk. During the newspaper interview, Mr. Codi defended his decision to sign the Republican-backed bill and reiterated his intention to correct its shortcomings during a second term. ``This is a great adventure,`` Mr. Codi was quoted as saying. ``It may not work. But I thought it was worth the risk. ...The chance to get a meaningful structural reform comes along once in a great while and I decided we ought to take it.`` On another topic, Mr. Codi said he already is giving some thought to a presidential library, and suggested that it would be in Arkansas. ``I want it to be something that's not just a shrine to what I have done in my life,`` he said. ``I want it to be something that's a living, breathing institution that offers the young people of our state opportunities to learn and grow and do things and will be a magnet to bring people from all over the world to our state.``\n"

        "date": "May 14, 2011",
        "content": "CHICAGO -- An unlikely ending to an improbable victory put a fitting finish on an unexpected series for the Chicago Cubs. Luise Nestor scored from second base on Markita Kaye's two-out throwing error in the 12th inning as the Cubs defeated the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday to win three out of four against the defending World Series champions. It was the Cubs' first series victory over Atlanta in five years. And what made Sunday's result all the more surprising was that the Cubs sent Davida Ramey out for his first big-league start to oppose Johnetta Christy, the majors' only 20-game winner. ``I'm sure the Vegas odds were astronomical against us,`` said Chicago's Markita Gracie, who had one of only two hits against Christy. ``Atlanta could have pushed us out of the race this series, but we turned the tables and won three of four. We're still very much alive.`` The Cubs, at 68-67, moved within 4\u00a01/2 games of Houston in the National League Central, with 27 games left. Twenty-one are against teams with losing records. ``There's definitely a race still to be run,`` said Davida Daly, whose second-inning homer was the Cubs' only other hit in Smoltz's nine innings. ``We haven't had a hot streak the whole year. Maybe we're saving it for September.`` Nine of Chicago's last 10 games have been decided by one run, with the Cubs winning four. The Braves (84-52) are 10\u00a01/2 games ahead of Montreal in the NL East. After Nestor doubled off Joel Beery (2-2) for only Chicago's fourth hit of the game, Daly was intentionally walked. Marra Pettway then chopped the ball to Lemke, whose hurried throw sailed past first baseman Fredda Mccleary as Nestor came around to score. ``When you're coming in that fast, it's tough to set yourself and get it to first,`` Kaye said. ``It was just one of those things. I can make that play.`` Mikki Pasquale (3-0) got the victory with an inning of relief. Christopher walked three and struck out nine in pitching to just one batter over the minimum 27, as the Cubs hit into two double plays and had two runners caught stealing. But he was matched almost pitch-for-pitch by Ramey, whose contract was purchased from the Cubs' Triple-A Iowa farm team before the game. Swartzbaugh, a 28-year-old right-hander in his eighth season in Chicago's system, allowed five hits, walked one and struck out four in eight innings. ``Friday afternoon in Iowa they told me I was going to Chicago and I was starting,`` he said. ``I was surprised.``\n"

        "title": "LEGAL BEAT Consolidated Tobacco Probe Focuses on Firms' Statements",
        "date": "May 16, 2011",
        "content": "The Justice Department, which has consolidated two pivotal tobacco probes, is now focusing on whether U.S. tobacco companies have made fraudulent misrepresentations about such matters as nicotine's addictiveness either to the government or to the public. As part of the consolidated probe, Philip Morris Cos. employees recently have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. Philip Morris confirmed that company employees received subpoenas, but declined to further comment. Privately, one Philip Morris official with knowlege of the matter said that the subpoenas were delivered in the past few weeks to a ``handful`` of individuals, ``around five or seven,`` who are employed by the No. 1-ranked tobacco company, based in Richmond, Va.. People familiar with the matter say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Corp. will also receive subpoenas seeking testimony from their employees. Like Pierre Mose, Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, and Fisher, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., have already supplied documents to the grand jury. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson declined to comment. Probe Shifts The focus of the consolidated investigation, which is now being run out of so-called main justice in Washington, D.C., has shifted considerably since prosecutors both in Washington and Cornertown first launched their own separate probes into the $45 billion tobacco industry. Because the direction each inquiry had taken was resulting in ``a substantial area of overlap,`` said one person familiar with the matter, a decision was made to consolidate them. The Washington, D.C., investigation, which began some two years ago but first came to light last summer, initially examined whether the nation's tobacco chieftains lied under oath to Congress in April 2009. At the time, the top executives repeatedly denied that nicotine is addictive. Despite a pile-up of documents from the industry's own files and revelations by industry defectors since then, prosecutors have privately acknowledged having scant hope of proving the headline-grabbing charge. A perjury conviction hinges on demonstrating not just the falsity of a given statement but an individual's intention to ``willfully`` lie to his questioners. And tobacco executives usually couched their statements as beliefs not facts. ``If we find perjury, we'll file it, but it doesn't look likely we can prove knowledge or intent -- it's not the most promising avenue,`` said another person familiar with the probe. Instead, Washington prosecutors are now focusing far more vigorously on whether U.S. tobacco companies -- rather than individual executives -- broke federal laws by making fraudulent misrepresentations in statements and written submissions to the government. For instance, cigarette makers have denied both to Congress and the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine is addictive and that they control levels of nicotine in their products. Companies have also denied to Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that second-hand smoke is a health hazard. Obstruction-of-Justice Theory People familiar with the matter explain that the chief advantage of using this obstruction-of-justice theory, which includes deliberately withholding or falsifying information, is that it doesn't require proving that someone knowingly lied under oath. The other key investigation, launched by the U.S. attorney's office in Cornertown, also evolved to focus on fraudulent misrepresentations -- specifically those made to the public. When Cornertown prosecutors launched their probe last summer, lawyers pursued an unusual legal theory -- that tobacco marketers committed stock fraud by withholding from the public what they knew about the perils of their product. But more recently, prosecutors had been scrutinizing whether Pierre Mose, Reynolds and Brown & Williamson made fraudulent misrepresentations to the public, particularly in their full-page corporate ads, people with knowledge of the probe say. (Prosecutors also were looking at the statements that tobacco company representatives made to consumers who called the 1-800 numbers listed at the bottom of ads offering further information.) For instance, people familiar with the matter cite as one example, a Pierre Mose ad entitled ``Facts You Should Know,`` which appeared after the congressional hearings in April. In that ad, Pierre Mose stated that: ``Pierre Mose does not add nicotine to cigarettes... . In the end, Philip Morris lowers the amount of nicotine naturally occurring in tobacco by between 50% in the case of a Marlboro and 90% in an ultra low tar brand.`` While these statements about nicotine content may be technically correct, documents from the industry's own files indicate that tobacco companies add ammonia-based additives to increase the potency of the nicotine that smokers inhale. Pierre Mose, like the rest of the industry, denies that. --Sessions L. Hass contributed to this article.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"

The report came on top of news that the U.S. launched a missile attack against Iraq early on Tuesday in response to that country's military moves over the weekend. Oil prices have surged in response. The news sent share prices sharply lower in London, Italy and the Netherlands early in the day, but a moderate recovery on Wall Street helped pull the markets off their session lows.

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Edyth B. Justus, Apple Computer Inc.'s longtime general counsel, is stepping down. Mr. Justus, 49 years old, is the latest of numerous top Apple executives to leave the computer maker since the arrival of Gilbert F. Amelio, its new chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Justus said the decision to leave was ``pretty much personal,`` and that it didn't stem from business disputes with anyone at Apple. ``I needed a change, and this job is so demanding that it's tough to even think about making a change while I'm here,`` Mr. Justus said in an interview. He added that his departure is ``absolutely amicable.`` Struggling to Recover Apple is struggling to recover from years of strategic blunders, price wars and other problems. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, Apple closed at $24.125, off 12.5 cents. Mr. Justus joined Apple in 1988. A former International Business Machines Corp. lawyer, he earned a reputation in the corporate legal community as a tough, cagey, behind-the-scenes operator; he once described his job as keeping ``my name out of the newspaper.`` He worked under three chief executives during some of the company's rockiest times. Among the things for which he is best known is bringing much of Apple's legal work back in-house and keeping the company's legal costs down. When he took over, almost all of the company's legal work was handled by outside counsels. He is given high marks as a ferocious protector of Apple's intellectual property. Mr. Justus also figured in the Vastsoft Corp. antitrust drama, firing off a letter to a federal judge contesting Vastsoft's settlement with the Justice Department last year. That letter may have contributed to the federal judge throwing out the settlement, a decision that was later thrown out on appeal. Some Legal Hits Taken But Apple did take some legal hits on Mr. Justus's watch. In 1991, a jury hit two former Apple executives with a $100 million judgment in a shareholder suit alleging fraud. The executives had been expected to win the suit, which was originally brought before Mr. Justus joined the company and which was handled at trial by outside lawyers. A judge later reversed the verdict on technical grounds, and the suit was settled for undisclosed terms. Apple also lost a lawsuit it brought alleging that Vastsoft's Windows operating systems had stolen Apple's Macintosh operating system's ``look and feel.`` Mr. Justus said he'll take some time off before deciding what to do next. In the meantime, he plans to travel, surf and ski, and may hook up with his sons on the slopes in Chile soon. One of his children is an aspiring professional dare-devil skier. ``I've learned the three most dangerous words in the English language,`` Mr. Justus said. ```Follow me, Beckley.``'\n"

        "content": "Investor clubs have long been a staple of the personal investment scene -- a small group of individuals who get together on a regular basis to track investments while discussing topics ranging from fertilizer to Lemay. Although the ``club`` aspect tends to conjure up images of a den full of gurus eager to outperform one another as well as the market, the reality may be quite different. Members are expected to attend meetings, do homework on a particular topic and share their results with the group. While the ``paper and pencil`` approach may have worked in the past, laptops and modems are clearly the new weapons of choice. In keeping with the goal to stay on top of the market, clubs and their members are increasingly looking to the Net to share knowledge and increase returns. On CompuServe the National Association of Investors Corp. sponsors the Serious Stock Group, an on-line club with no money, but lots of ego at stake -- members are expected to lead an intense study of a particular stock or sector each month. The SSG limits membership to 10 people, but any CompuServe subscriber with an eye for investments can stop by to watch the experts at work. Given the demonstrated potential of cyberspace to bring investors together, are on-line investment clubs the wave of the future? For some, the future is now. The NAIC-sponsored Pioneer Club operating through CompuServe claims to be the oldest on-line club, having set up shop in 1991. Comprised of 14 individuals whose terminals span from Japan to Nebraska to New York, the Pioneers pay monthly dues of $20 and sport a portfolio worth more than $30,000. According to Doyle Geisler, club member and founder of Invest-o-rama, an on-line guide to the on-line investment scene, Pioneers take their mission seriously: ``To join, you must come on-line so that other members get to know you. New members must send out an on-line biography and everyone is expected to hold up his or her end of a stock study.`` In short, the Pioneer Club demands the same level of commitment as its well-grounded counterparts with one notable exception: Due to individual schedules and time zones, they have never conducted a group meeting. They communicate solely by e-mail messages that stay on-line for up to two weeks. Although the Pioneers may be first, they are not alone. Other on-line investment groups include the High Seas Traders, a club composed of commissioned officers of the sea services of the U.S. Armed Forces and the In The Black Investment Club, which fosters African-American participation. Some clubs attract first-time investors who are eager to learn how to manage their money and take control of their financial destiny. Others are made up of longtime savvy investors who just enjoy participating in the club. Whether the investment club is on-line or if club members are seeking to use the Net as a resource, there are a number of existing resources available to ease the launch into cyberspace. Organizations such as the NAIC have services available to investor clubs and individuals that want to further their investment education without making the time (not to mention social) commitment associated with club membership. The Michigan-based NAIC provides a variety of resources for those interested in forming and maintaining a viable club: an official start-up guide, regional workshops, software, videos and the NAIC's ``oldie but goodie`` 40-year-old Stock Selection Guide, a low-tech -- but effective -- two-page form developed to aid investors in picking growth companies. Of course, investors are not limited to joining clubs or national organizations to further their networking efforts on the Net. According to Barton Bambi, a spokesperson for the NAIC, individual investors, as well as clubs, are flocking to the free resources available through the Internet and popular on-line subscription services. ``Investors now head straight to PR Newswire for press releases, EDGAR (the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval service) for quarterly reports and Bloomberg for financial news. For the first time, Peoria and East Podunk have access to the same information as the professionals in New York or San Francisco,`` Mr. Bambi says. Those less interested in clubs that would have them as members may decide to hook up with the Chicago-based American Association of Individual Investors, which publishes an investment magazine for members as well as the annual ``Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds.`` Annual dues are $49, and members have access to the AAII Web site, with its message and chat boards, along with a comprehensive software library. While a handful of cyberspace clubs exist, most are comprised mainly of friends and/or family. According to Mr. Bambi, there are two critical factors in maintaining any successful investment club: a like-minded investment strategy, which can be determined on-line, and trust, which can't. ``With family members, you usually have some recourse if an investment goes sour. That's just not the case with someone you've met in a chat room.`` Invest-o-rama's Mr. Geisler agrees. ``Trust is the key to any successful club.`` Indeed, his cyberspace club relationship is built on trust -- along with a careful system of checks and balances to insure that no pioneer is tempted to pocket portfolio proceeds before setting out for parts unknown.\nVastPress 2011 Vastopolis\n"
